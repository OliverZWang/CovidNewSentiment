Scientists already knew that once the virus breaks into a cell, it forms double-membrane sacs, or vesicles, in which it makes copies of its genetic material. But the sacs appeared to be closed and it was previously unclear how the genetic material moved from the sac into the fluid in the cell, where new virus particles assembled themselves. Eric Snijder of Leiden University Medical Center and his colleagues discovered tiny channels through both membranes that are wide enough to let the genetic material pass through. \"In electron microscope images we can see 'stuff' sticking out of these channels. Most likely this 'stuff' is the viral RNA on its way out, but as the sample is frozen, there is no movement and we still need to find ways to properly identify the 'stuff' as viral RNA,\" Snijder told Reuters. \"Blocking this channel somehow...could create a big problem for the virus to do its tricks,\" he added.

More than 74,000 people have now been infected by the virus in China, with hundreds more cases in some 25 countries. The situation remains serious at the epicentre, with the director of a hospital in the central city of Wuhan becoming the seventh medical worker to succumb to the COVID-19 illness. But Chinese officials released a study showing most patients have mild cases of the infection, and World Health Organization officials said the mortality rate was relatively low. The outbreak is threatening to put a dent in the global economy, with China paralysed by vast quarantine measures and major firms such as iPhone maker Apple and mining giant BHP warning it could damage bottom lines. Several countries have banned travellers from China and major airlines have suspended flights -- something that Beijing's ambassador to the EU warned was fuelling panic and threatening attempts to resume business. Russia on Tuesday said no Chinese citizens would be allowed to enter its territory from February 20. The epidemic has triggered panic-buying in Singapore and Hong Kong, concerns about cruise-ship travel and the postponement of trade fairs, sports competitions and cultural events in China and abroad. Authorities have placed about 56 million people in hard-hit central Hubei and its capital Wuhan under an unprecedented lockdown. The city was carrying out \"very good public health practice\" with door-to-door surveillance, said Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme. Other cities far from the epicentre have restricted the movement of residents, with a 14-day self-quarantine for people returning to Beijing. President Xi Jinping, in a phone call with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said China's measures were achieving \"visible progress\", according to state media. - 'Less deadly' than SARS - The official death toll in China hit 2,000 after another 132 people died in Hubei, where the virus emerged in December. Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, became its latest victim, sparking an outpouring of grief online. Earlier this month, the death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang -- who had been punished by authorities for sounding the alarm about the virus in late December -- triggered anger and calls on social media for political reform. Official figures, meanwhile, showed there were nearly 1,700 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday in Hubei. New infections have been falling in the rest of the country for the past two weeks. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that it was too early to tell if the decline would continue. A study among tens of thousands of confirmed and suspected cases showed that 81 percent of patients had only mild infections. The study released by China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also showed the death rate stood at 2.3 percent, falling below one percent for people in their 30s and 40s. WHO officials said the COVID-19 illness was \"less deadly\" than its cousins, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). But it is higher than the mortality rate for the seasonal flu, at around 0.1 percent in the United States. Ryan said the outbreak was \"very serious\" and could grow, but stressed that outside Hubei the epidemic was \"affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people\". There have been some 900 cases around the world, with five deaths in France, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Another 88 people tested positive for the virus on the quarantined Diamond Prince cruise ship off Yokohama in Japan, raising the number of those infections to 542. The US has repatriated more than 300 American passengers and Britain became the latest country to offer its citizens a way off the ship after similar plans by Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and South Korea. And around 500 passengers were to leave the vessel on Wednesday after testing negative for the virus. burs-lth-rox/jah", "score": -0.9951, "label": 0}, {"text": "* Worries about China virus grow ahead of Lunar New Year * Data shows Singapore inflation picked up slightly in Dec * Indonesia's central bank keeps interest rates unchanged * Philippine cenbank says 7% growth attainable in 2020 By Soumyajit Saha Jan 23 (Reuters) - Most Southeast stock markets ended lower on Thursday as mounting concerns of a coronavirus outbreak in China sapped confidence, while the Philippine index marked its best session in more than three months as traders picked up beaten-down stocks. Investors remained anxious about the spread of the virus as China ordered a lockdown on Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million people, ahead of the travel-heavy Chinese New Year holiday.

The Thai index traded flat in the absence of any market-moving catalysts, while Malaysian shares hit their lowest close in more than a month, dented by healthcare and consumer sectors. Latex glove manufacturer Hartalega Holdings fell 2.6%, while conglomerate Genting Bhd closed 2.3% weaker.

Real estate developer Ayala Land advanced 3.6%, while packaged food producer Universal Robina Corp ended 5.2% firmer. \"I would look into the performance over the last few days, which is mostly weak, so today's bounce back mostly looks like bargain-hunting from investors,\" said Charles William Ang, associate analyst at COL Financial Group. Gains in the resources and consumer sectors helped Indonesian stocks snap three sessions of losses, with Chandra Asri Petrochemical advancing 1.3%, while cigarette maker Gudang Garam ended 1.1% firmer.

Everything in her book that I\u2019m familiar with is spot on. There is plenty in the book, however, that I wasn\u2019t aware of, and I suspect that\u2019s the reason the president and his siblings have gone to court to try to halt its publication. The Trumps know that Mary\u2019s understanding of her family is authentic \u2014 she\u2019s a true insider in an era when \u201cinsider\u201d accounts of the president are a dime-a-dozen \u2014 and that what she\u2019s written is likely to be indelible.The subtitle of Mary\u2019s book is \u201cHow My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man,\u201d and she makes her case diligently and chronologically.Fred Sr. was steely and unforgiving, while his wife, Mary, lived in his shadow, emotionally distant and demanding. The Queens mansion where Donald grew up as his father\u2019s favorite is an intimidating pile that Mary calls The House. In the basement of The House, Fred Sr., a teetotaler, kept an elegant bar outfitted with everything but alcohol and guarded by a collection of life-sized wooden statues of Native American chiefs standing along a wall. An oil painting of a lovely Black nightclub singer with \u201cgenerous swaying hips\u201d backed by a Black jazz band hung on a wall nearby. That was apparently as close as Fred Sr. wanted Black people to get to his family. The son of a German immigrant, he slurred any person of color seeking to rent an apartment from him as \u201cdie Schwarze.\u201d Roy Cohn, the infamous lawyer and mob confidante, came into the Trumps\u2019 lives when Fred Sr. and Donald retained him to battle a Justice Department probe of racial discrimination at Trump properties in the 1970s.Fred Sr. ruled the roost, and in Mary\u2019s view he did so as a sociopath, driving her father to ruin and forcing her Uncle Donald to adapt to his binary, winner-take-all view of the world. Losing was unacceptable, and the power of positive thinking was everything. \u201cJust give it a quarter of a turn on the mental carburetor,\u201d Fred Sr. advised Fred Jr. as the way to conquer alcoholism. Mary writes that after Fred Jr. died, the Trumps apparently schemed to disinherit her and her brother, cutting off their health insurance when they wouldn\u2019t play along.Donald, more than any of his four siblings, reveled in Fred Sr.\u2019s hothouse. He stole one of his brother\u2019s trucks as a child just so he could see how anguished his brother might become. He bucked authority as a teenager, prompting his parents to send him to military school. According to Mary, he paid someone to take the SAT exams for him so he could get into a better college. When Fred Sr. slipped into dementia soon before dying, Donald, strapped for cash, maneuvered unsuccessfully to push his siblings aside and gain control of an estate worth several hundred million dollars. Although Donald\u2019s entire career was built on Fred Sr.\u2019s wealth and connections, Donald treated his father dismissively in his final years. Then again, Fred Sr. treated most people dismissively, and Donald is what Mary describes as a \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s monster,\u201d shaped by his father\u2019s pathologies. Fred Sr. lacked the marketing savvy and media know-how of his son, so he helped push Donald into the spotlight and risked the family fortune along the way so he could bask in his son\u2019s glory. Donald thrived on the attention and took advantage of the license afforded by his father\u2019s wealth, eventually adopting \u201ccheating as a way of life.\u201d Mary takes the media to task for searching for a \u201cstrategy\u201d in anything Donald does and for soft-pedaling what she describes as multiple psychological disorders, which, by her account, check a variety of boxes in diagnostic manuals.

The number of new daily cases around the country climbed to a near-record high. Texas halted its phased economic reopening in response to a jump in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. Over 36,000 new U.S. cases were recorded on Wednesday, a few hundred shy of an April 24 record high, making investors more pessimistic about the chances of a quick economic recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s really fast accelerating in a lot of U.S. states, which is going to continue to be a problem for markets,\u201d said Erik Nelson, a macro strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. Data on Thursday showed weak demand is forcing U.S. employers to lay off workers, keeping new applications for unemployment benefits extraordinarily high, even as businesses have reopened. New orders for U.S.-made capital goods rebounded more than expected in May, but recouped only a portion of the prior two months' declines. Forex markets have mostly tracked moves in equities as risk sentiment changes. Wall Street was mixed on Thursday following the S&P 500's worst day in two weeks. The U.S. dollar index was last up 0.18% on the day at 97.41. A dispute between the United States and the European Union, in which Washington is flagging possible changes in tariffs on EU goods, also hurt risk sentiment. The euro slipped as riskier assets in the region, including Italian bonds, weakened, and as the European Central Bank fought back against a German court challenge to its money-printing plans. \"There\u2019s a little bit of unease going on in the European financial markets, which is probably weighing on the euro,\" said Nelson.

Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) with the Xoft \u00ae Axxent \u00ae Electronic Brachytherapy (eBx \u00ae ) System \u00ae offers a viable solution that could potentially alleviate the burden to our health system, while enabling clinicians to administer high-quality care to patients who are candidates, while minimizing their potential exposure to the novel coronavirus.\u201d", "score": 0.9666, "label": 1}, {"text": "Xoft breast IORT is a single-fraction therapy option that allows select early-stage breast cancer patients to replace weeks of daily radiation with one treatment, delivered at the time of surgery.

For patients, it offers added convenience, with better cosmetic outcomes and fewer side effects; from a physician standpoint there is an inherent efficiency, as it enables them to condense one month of daily treatments to a single dose of targeted radiation. Lastly, for payers, the overall cost of treatment is reduced as the course of treatment may be reduced from weeks of daily fractions to one concentrated dose of radiation, administered at the time of surgery.\u201d", "score": 0.9216, "label": 1}, {"text": "\u201cAs clinicians, we are going to have to adapt to the COVID-19 situation as it evolves.

But one South Tyrolean vintner in the northern province of Bolzano took matters into his own hands, renting a plane to fly in his team of long-time workers from Romania. Every summer, tens of thousands of farm workers from Africa and Eastern Europe come to Italy to harvest fruit and vegetables. The outbreak of coronavirus, which locked down Italy in early March, made it almost impossible for these vital foreign workers to come. Martin Hofstaetter, whose vines are located around the picturesque town of Termeno, has relied for more than ten years on a team of female Romanian pickers. Usually, they arrive in a small bus and stay for a few months. But this year, despite having the right to work in Italy, they were turned away at the Hungarian border. Hofstaetter was quick to act, hiring a small plane to transport the women directly from Romania to Termeno at his own expense. \"We had never been on a plane before. It was a great experience for us,\" Maria Codrea, from Calinesti in Romania, told AFPTV. Codrea, 39, said she depended on the annual work in Italy. Staying back in Romania \"would have been hard,\" she said. \"Even where we are, everything is closed, factories and everything.\" - Italians hard to find - Codrea will stay until mid-July in Termeno with her team of seven other Romanian women before returning home. A second team of about 20 workers from Romania will arrive in Termeno at the end of August for the harvest. Hofstaetter, whose wines include the famous white varieties of Italy's northeast, said he might have been able to find Italian workers, \"but now the Italians no longer want to work in the fields or vineyards.\" \"The Italians disappear after a few days\" of the back-breaking work, he added. It was a shame that work in agriculture was not \"more highly valued\", he said, but he was very happy with the skills and dedication of the Romanians, who had been picking for him for over 10 years. Last week, the first group of about 100 foreign farm workers arrived in Italy from Morocco, their transport paid for by a farmers' association in the eastern region of Abruzzo.

Walsh said the cuts \"will have a significant impact on the shape and size of our F1 team\". British media reports said about 70 of the racing team's 800 jobs will be eliminated by the restructuring plan. \"It is a course of action we have worked hard to avoid, having already undertaken dramatic cost-saving measures across all areas of business,\" Walsh said. \"But we now have no further choice but to reduce the size of our workforce.\" - Racing heritage - McLaren is a grand name in British racing that has produced cars featured in James Bond movies and bred winners of Formula 1 races since the 1960s. It is the second-oldest team currently on the circuit and trails only Ferrari in total number of wins. McLaren won 12 drivers' titles -- including with racing legends Alain Prost and the late Ayrton Senna -- and the Constructors' Championship on eight occasions. But the group's racing division has struggled in recent years. Its two current drivers -- Spaniard Carlos Sainz Jr. and British-Belgian Lando Norris -- have no victories and just one podium finish between them. McLaren is now lobbying Formula 1 to introduce a budget cap next year that could reduce the gap between less well-funded teams and runaway leaders such as Mercedes and Ferrari. The Formula 1 season has been suspended and is not eyeing a return until July. Orders for McLaren's supercars have also fallen steeply. Walsh said the group has invested in developing \"a new lightweight, hybrid vehicle architecture\" that will enter serial production at the end of the year. Most car manufacturers have had to dramatically scale back production because global lockdowns reduced their available work force. Car sales in Italy imploded by 98 percent in April -- a month in which almost all of the Mediterranean country's factories were shut. Sky News reported that McLaren intended to raise \ufffd275 million ($340 million / 310 million euros) \"against the value of its classic car collection\" and its headquarters building in the southern English city of Surrey. The report said Britain's Jaguar Land Rover was also in talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government about a \"mammoth\" loan.

Increased expansion of home automation devices, such as lights, locks, and security cameras, with remote technology on smartphones, tablets, or wearables, generates greater consumer demand to ensure maximum safety. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) solutions are expected to make a significant contribution while responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing ever-changing challenges. The current situation as a result of the outbreak of the epidemic will encourage pharmaceutical suppliers and healthcare establishments to enhance their R&D investment in AI, acting as a key technology for enabling various initiatives. The insurance industry is expected to face the pressure associated with cost-efficiency. Using AI will help reduce operating costs and, at the same time, increase customer satisfaction during the renewal process, claims, and other services. VR/AR will assist in e-learning, which would boost competition due to the closure of many schools and universities.

Worldwide, close to 3,100 people have succumbed to the illness even as a clear shift in the crisis was emerging, with nine times as many cases recorded outside China as inside, according to the UN health agency. Andorra, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Jordan, Latvia, Portugal, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia were among countries that confirmed their first cases, along with Senegal, which became the second sub-Saharan African country to do so. All of the US deaths have occurred in the state of Washington, where officials warned residents the battle against the disease was shifting from containment to mitigation. \"The risk for all of us of becoming infected will be increasing,\" said Jeff Duchin, a health officer in King County where five of the deaths occurred. The district is home to Seattle, a city with a population of more than 700,000 people. The White House, which has been accused of downplaying the threat from the virus, continued to strike a bullish tone. Vice President Mike Pence declared that a treatment \"could literally be available by this summer, or early fall.\" He was likely referring to remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed by the pharmaceutical firm Gilead that has already been used to treat one US patient and was moving toward two expansive final stage trials in Asia. Pence also announced American pharmaceuticals were teaming up in a consortium to fight the virus, and said that South Korea and Italy, two of the hardest-hit nations, would screen all their airline passengers bound for the US. Despite its world-class hospitals and cutting edge research, the US is viewed as vulnerable to an epidemic because of glaring disparities in its health care system, including nearly 28 million people without coverage. - 'Window of opportunity' - With fears of a pandemic on the rise after the virus emerged in China late last year, the World Health Organization urged countries to stock up on critical care ventilators to treat patients with severe symptoms. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a \"window of opportunity\" remained to contain the outbreak, noting that \"more than 130 countries have not detected any cases yet.\" Globally, the virus has infected nearly 90,000 people in more than 60 nations. Italy, Europe's worst-affected country with around 1,700 infections, said Monday its deaths from the virus had jumped 18 to 52. The outbreak has raised fears for the world economy, with the OECD slashing its global growth forecast by half a percentage point to 2.4 percent, the worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. But strength on Wall Street -- which rebounded from sharp losses last week to post gains of more than five percent Monday -- helped European markets emerge from the red after governments and central banks said they would step in if needed to soften the blow. China's economy has halted with large swathes of the country under quarantine or subject to strict travel restrictions. Other countries have enacted their own containment measures including travel restrictions, locking down towns and suspending major events. The Louvre -- the world's most visited museum -- was closed on Sunday and Monday after staff refused to work while the UN headquarters in Geneva said it was closing to visitors. In Italy, tourist hotpots including the Duomo in Milan reopened to visitors but access was limited to avoid overcrowding in a bid to contain the virus. Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden barred flights from Iran while France, Germany and Britain said they would send aid to the Middle Eastern nation. Iran reported 12 more deaths on Monday, raising the country's toll to 66, the second biggest after China's, while its overall number of cases rose to 1,501. - South Korea sect - China reported 42 more deaths on Monday -- all in central Hubei province, bringing the death toll to 2,912. The pathogen is believed to have originated in a market that sold wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan. Overall, China recorded just 202 new infections however, the lowest daily rise since late January, bringing the nationwide total to over 80,000, as massive quarantine efforts paid off. The WHO says the virus appears to particularly hit people over the age of 60 and those already weakened by other illnesses. Its mortality rate is between two and five percent. South Korea, the worst affected outside China, reported nearly 500 new cases on Monday, raising its total past 4,000. Four more people died there, taking the toll to 22. Half of South Korea's cases are linked to a sect whose leader Lee Man-hee apologized Monday for the spread of the disease.
