Leasing office!\\'\" Now, the single mother is worried that she and her four children will become homeless.\\nLattin is one of millions of Americans facing eviction amid the coronavirus pandemic. Even as unemployment levels remain at historic highs and cases of the virus continue to surge, the federal eviction moratorium in the first stimulus package was allowed to expire at the end of last month.\\nPresident Donald Trump said the executive action he took over the weekend would help keep renters in their homes, but advocates say the move won\\'t actually do much .\\n\"It creates the impression that something was done when, in fact, nothing was done,\" said John Pollock , coordinator of the National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel.\\nMore from Personal Finance:\\nTrump wants stimulus checks to be more than $1,200\\nHow HEALS Act stimulus checks would be different\\nHow soon you can expect another stimulus check in the mail\\nMeanwhile, statewide bans on evictions have ended in more than 30 states.\\xa0By one estimate, some 40 million Americans could lose their homes during the public health crisis, four times the amount seen during the Great Recession.\\n\"The United States is facing the most severe housing crisis in history,\" said Emily Benfer, visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University.\\nEven though most relief measures have dried up by now, there might be rules in place to help keep you in your home.\\nThe CARES Act passed in March banned evictions\\xa0in\\xa0properties with federally backed mortgages and for tenants who receive government-assisted housing. That protection expired on July 24.\\nStill, landlords must give tenants who were protected by the CARES Act at least 30 days notice before they evict them, said Alexis Erkert ,\\xa0a lawyer at Southeast Louisiana Legal Services.\\nNormally, an eviction judgement in Louisiana can be as little as 24 hours. \"So it\\'s a really big deal for tenants here that their landlords have to give them 30 days notice,\" Erkert said.\\nGovernment-sponsored lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac released tools recently that help renters search their property to learn if it qualifies for the eviction moratorium, and therefore the 30 days notice.\\xa0The Urban Institute estimates the provision covers nearly 30% of the country\\'s rental units.\\nMeanwhile, many courts have moved to remote hearings during the public health crisis. In some courts, both the landlord and tenant have to agree to a virtual hearing. If they don\\'t, the case won\\'t be scheduled until the hearings move back to the courtroom, Benfer said. This can be another way to buy yourself some time.\\nIn some states where the statewide moratorium on evictions has lapsed, some towns, cities and counties have established their own protections for renters. You can find out what policies apply to you in this database that Benfer continues to update. Your landlord might not know of them, or be ignoring them .\\nAt Justshelter.org, you can search for community resources for people at risk of eviction. Some states and cities have funds allocated to help people stay in their homes. Arizona earmarked $5 million for that purpose. Residents in Delaware can apply for up to $1,500 in rental assistance . Similar relief measures were made available to those in Montana , Ohio , Iowa and New York . If you\\'re accepted for the assistance, make sure to let your landlord know right away.\\nMany landlords are showing a willingness to work with tenants who ask for payment plans, experts say.
