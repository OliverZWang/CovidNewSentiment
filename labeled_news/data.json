[{"RECORDID": "20200811-38496", "label": -1, "title": "What to do if you're at risk of eviction", "body": "Alaina Lattin was served an eviction notice last month at her home in Conroe, Texas.\n\"It was a very loud banging,\" Lattin, 32, said. \"They just kept screaming, 'Leasing office! Leasing office!'\" Now, the single mother is worried that she and her four children will become homeless.\nLattin is one of millions of Americans facing eviction amid the coronavirus pandemic. Even as unemployment levels remain at historic highs and cases of the virus continue to surge, the federal eviction moratorium in the first stimulus package was allowed to expire at the end of last month.\nPresident Donald Trump said the executive action he took over the weekend would help keep renters in their homes, but advocates say the move won't actually do much .\n\"It creates the impression that something was done when, in fact, nothing was done,\" said John Pollock , coordinator of the National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nTrump wants stimulus checks to be more than $1,200\nHow HEALS Act stimulus checks would be different\nHow soon you can expect another stimulus check in the mail\nMeanwhile, statewide bans on evictions have ended in more than 30 states.\u00a0By one estimate, some 40 million Americans could lose their homes during the public health crisis, four times the amount seen during the Great Recession.\n\"The United States is facing the most severe housing crisis in history,\" said Emily Benfer, visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University.\nEven though most relief measures have dried up by now, there might be rules in place to help keep you in your home.\nThe CARES Act passed in March banned evictions\u00a0in\u00a0properties with federally backed mortgages and for tenants who receive government-assisted housing. That protection expired on July 24.\nStill, landlords must give tenants who were protected by the CARES Act at least 30 days notice before they evict them, said Alexis Erkert ,\u00a0a lawyer at Southeast Louisiana Legal Services.\nNormally, an eviction judgement in Louisiana can be as little as 24 hours. \"So it's a really big deal for tenants here that their landlords have to give them 30 days notice,\" Erkert said.\nGovernment-sponsored lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac released tools recently that help renters search their property to learn if it qualifies for the eviction moratorium, and therefore the 30 days notice.\u00a0The Urban Institute estimates the provision covers nearly 30% of the country's rental units.\nMeanwhile, many courts have moved to remote hearings during the public health crisis. In some courts, both the landlord and tenant have to agree to a virtual hearing. If they don't, the case won't be scheduled until the hearings move back to the courtroom, Benfer said. This can be another way to buy yourself some time.\nIn some states where the statewide moratorium on evictions has lapsed, some towns, cities and counties have established their own protections for renters. You can find out what policies apply to you in this database that Benfer continues to update. Your landlord might not know of them, or be ignoring them .\nAt Justshelter.org, you can search for community resources for people at risk of eviction. Some states and cities have funds allocated to help people stay in their homes. Arizona earmarked $5 million for that purpose. Residents in Delaware can apply for up to $1,500 in rental assistance . Similar relief measures were made available to those in Montana , Ohio , Iowa and New York . If you're accepted for the assistance, make sure to let your landlord know right away.\nMany landlords are showing a willingness to work with tenants who ask for payment plans, experts say. Debi Stobi owns a 25-unit building in Lakewood, Colorado. So far, she said, she's managed not to evict anyone during the pandemic.\n\"We'd rather work something out than having nothing at all,\" Stobi said.\u00a0\"Landlords don't want to evict tenants.\"\nSome tenants are using their credit cards to cover their rent . Few landlords or property managers accept plastic, so you'd have to find a third-party processor, such as Plastiq , Paypal or RadPad .\n\"Their pitch is that you could pay them with a credit card and then they would mail a check to your landlord or send an electronic funds deposit,\" said Ted Rossman,\u00a0an analyst at CreditCards.com.\nHow you can save $1 million for retirement\nHow much the most populous states pay mail carriers\nCreepy ways your company can spy on you while you work from home\nMajor companies suspend social media advertising over online hate speech\nWomen and retirement planning\nThis bookshop survived earthquakes and recessions.

The companies charge a fee (up to 2.85%, Rossman said), and then if you can't pay the credit card balance off immediately, you'll be dinged with interest fees. The average rate on a card is currently around 16%.\nOther ways to come up with rent can include borrowing from family and friends or from your retirement plan , Rossman said.\nIf an eviction hearing is looking inevitable, try to get a lawyer. One study in New Orleans found that more than 65% of tenants with no legal representation were evicted, compared with fewer than 15% of those who did have a lawyer.\nYou can find low-cost or free legal help with an eviction in your state at Lawhelp.org .\nSometimes the paperwork you receive with your hearing date will have the contact information for legal services in your area. If not, you should be able to find your agency online, Erkert said.\u00a0\"The court may also be able to give people contact information,\" she said.\nNo matter what \u2014 and whether it's by telephone, over video or in person \u2014 try to be present at your hearing, Erkert said.\n\"A lot of tenants don't show up, which means they will get a default judgment against them,\" she added. \"If they show up, many judges will at least give them extra time to move.\"\nHave you applied for a rental assistance program where you live?

Usually, an international crowd of collectors fly in to peruse its endless booths of Indigenous-made items. Held at the historic Santa Fe Plaza, it\u2019s a grand event where many of the participating artists make a significant portion of their income for the year. Their pieces\u2014ranging from clothing to accessories and art\u2014are labors of love that take weeks, and sometimes months, to create; they spend all year leading up to it making them. For many, it\u2019s also a long-standing tradition to show there\u2014something that has been done since 1922.\nBut naturally, the market has gone virtual this summer as a result of the pandemic, and all of its participating artists are now selling their works online, with digital support from the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA), which organizes the market every year. Throughout the month of August, artists from a variety of tribes will be posting new works to their websites that were made especially for market month.\nShopping is just one part of the market. In mid-August, it will host a virtual runway show featuring a handful of Indigenous designers\u2014the star attraction will be a brand-new collection from Orlando Dugi , a veteran Din\u00e9 designer. Other labels, such as Korina Emmerich and Catherine Blackburn , both featured on Vogue before, will be showing as well. Some of the Santa Fe Indian Market\u2019s signature events, such as the Clothing Contest , which displays the best of traditional wears, will also go virtual. Submissions can be entered electronically, and judges will post the winners, based on photos, at the end of the month.\nThe market\u2019s shoppable booths, however, are undeniably the most-missed event this summer. But fans of Indigenous artwork, accessories, and ready-to-wear can easily find unique works online now, thanks to the new virtual format\u2014and Vogue is highlighting some must-know artists worth checking out for authentic, one-of-a-kind designs.\nBelow, eight artists to know from this year\u2019s virtual market.\nElias Jade Not Afraid\u2019s modern, unexpected aesthetic fuses traditional techniques with skull and rose motifs. A prominent Aps\u00e1alooke beadwork artist based in Whitecone, Arizona, he told Vogue last year, \u201cI taught myself how to do the traditional Crow-style beadwork technique\u2026beading with two needles: one threads the beads, and the other tacks down the beads on thread every two to three beads.\u201d For now, he operates mainly on Instagram , where he posts new works and occasionally opens up his DMs for orders too.\nRobin Waynee is a Saginaw Chippewa jewelry designer based in Santa Fe. Her ornate, delicate pieces have won her many awards at the Santa Fe Indian Market, and she learned the craft from her father, who was also a jeweler and sculptor. Her most well-known pieces are her statement earrings made of luxe materials, such as Tahitian pearls, pink sapphires, and diamonds.\nTom Farris is a multidisciplinary artist who is Otoe-Missouria and Cherokee from Norman, Oklahoma. His contemporary works, which include paintings and sculptures, have been exhibited at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian and come with a sense of humor rooted in history and culture. This installation of an Indigenous-themed slot machine, for instance, plays on how tribes are reclaiming their land through tribal gaming and casinos.\nCara Romero, a Chemehuevi photographer from Santa Fe, creates arresting photographs rooted in current events and issues within the Indigenous community. They also highlight traditional aspects of her own tribe. One of her newest images, titled Puha (The Path), depicts four Indigenous boys on the Chemehuevi Valley Indian Reservations learning to sing their traditional gourd songs.\nKorina Emmerich is the Puyallup designer of her ready-to-wear line, Emme . Emmerich, who is based in New York, will unveil a full new collection during the virtual fashion show later this month. Her colorful pieces channel her Indigenous heritage with a strong focus on social and climate justice (she is also involved with groups such as the Indigenous Kinship Collective and Slow Factory ). Recently, she has also been producing printed masks made from Pendleton wools.\nNaiomi Glasses learned how to weave from her family at a young age, and even created her first rug by the age of 18. Now, she\u2019s a seventh-generation Din\u00e9 textile weaver based on the Navajo Nation in Arizona. Glasses produces a range of textile products from saddle blankets to crossbody bags, which she will be unveiling throughout the month. With a wardrobe full of amazing turquoises and Indigenous-owned clothing brands, her personal style is just as good as her work.\nPottery artist and clothing designer Virgil Ortiz is known for creating chic pottery barware, including glasses , made of glazed clay. As a Cochiti Pueblo pottery artist, he sometimes uses his work to pay homage to Indigenous figures in history as well, such as this vase based on the Zuni artist We\u2019wha, who was a notable Two-Spirit (an Indigenous individual who identifies as having both male and female traits).\nMaria Samora \u2019s sleek, minimal jewelry defies what one may expect from Indigenous craftwork, but her modern pieces are still crafted with love and quality. From Taos Pueblo in New Mexico, Samora runs the line with her jewelry-maker husband, Kevin Rebholtz. Her standout jewels include her sterling silver cage rings with diamond accents as well as her silver and turquoise feather earrings."}, {"RECORDID": "20200817-17810", "label": -1, "title": "Amazon Faces German Probe Over Controlling Prices On Its Platform Amid Pandemic", "body": "Third-party sellers allege that the Jeff Bezos-led company intervened in prices during the initial phase of the pandemic in Germany, which is Amazon's\u00a0second-largest market after the United States.\nAAPL\nSTZ\nTSLA\nAMZN\n\u201cWe are currently investigating whether and how Amazon influences how traders set prices on the market-place,\u201d Andreas Mundt, President of the Federal Cartel Office told local German media, as per Reuters.\nAn Amazon spokeswoman refuted the allegations, claiming, the company\u2019s \u201csystems are designed to take action against price gouging.\u201d\nUntil 2013, Amazon required merchants not to offer their products on rival websites at lower prices than they were charging on its portal\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a policy the company abandoned after Germany\u2019s antitrust authorities intervened, Reuters noted.\nGerman authorities reportedly halted an investigation into Amazon last year after the company reached a deal with them over terms of service applicable to third-party merchants.\nIn May, the retail giant asked the government in the United States to enact a law against price gouging during national emergencies.\nAmazon is also under an antitrust investigation\u00a0in the European Union for allegedly violating competition rules .

Information about the earliest donor in the state was incorrect in\u00a0an earlier version of the article.\nA Phoenix-area man who tested positive and fully recovered from COVID-19 donated his blood plasma April 15 as a possible treatment for critically ill patients.\nMayo Clinic has partnered with blood donation company\u00a0Vitalant\u00a0in a pilot program to collect\u00a0plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients to treat currently infected patients. The American Red Cross\u00a0also is working on this effort through a program out of Tucson and at clinics nationwide.\nStart the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.\nPlasma is liquid blood once\u00a0blood cells and platelets are removed. The idea is that recovered patients have developed antibodies in their blood \u2014 called \" convalescent plasma \" \u2014 to fight off the infection. If that is passed on to individuals struggling to fight the virus, it may boost\u00a0their immune response.\nJack Schmittlein, 21, who had been studying abroad in Spain, returned home to Scottsdale early\u00a0after the Europe travel ban. He had minor symptoms and decided to get tested when he found out his roommate in Barcelona had COVID-19.\u00a0Schmittlein tested positive on March 18, tested negative on April 2 and has fully recovered.\nHis Mayo Clinic doctors encouraged him to donate his plasma\u00a0\u2014 and to become the program's first convalescent COVID-19 plasma donor.\n\u201cI am just grateful that I came out healthy and I can turn around and help other people,\u201d he said in a released statement. \u201cIf I can make a difference for just one patient, that is a great thing to do!\u201d\nCOVID-19 is a new virus and there's not yet a vaccine or proven treatment. A number of clinical trials are well underway, but significant progress could still be months out.\nIn the meantime, plasma could be a solution, said Dr. Jill Adamski, chair of laboratory medicine at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. Adamski has been leading the clinic's convalescent plasma collection efforts in partnership with Vitalant.\n\"We're bypassing the need to have a vaccine, because we don't have one,\" Adamski said. \"We're able to essentially give somebody the same immunity that they would have received could we have vaccinated them.\"\n\nAs a public service, The Arizona Republic is offering coronavirus coverage relating to public safety free of charge.  Support The Republic by subscribing to azcentral.com.\nPlasma has been used as a medical therapy\u00a0since the early 1900s to fight off illnesses such as measles, polio, SARS, Ebola, H1N1 and other viruses. Recovered individuals have made antibodies to fight the disease and have developed immunity. Their blood plasma can help others to do the same.\nThe Food and Drug Administration is still investigating the use of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19.\u00a0It is allowing health care providers to use it in clinical trials or for patients and donors who meet certain conditions, but not yet for widespread or routine use.\n\"Essentially the FDA is blessing us to move forward to do these investigations and to try it, just because of the track record of doing this same thing over and over and over again every time we encounter a new virus that we don't have immunity against or a vaccine against,\" Adamski said.\nWAS THAT COVID-19?  Private labs see high demand for COVID-19 antibody test that detects past infections\nPeople must have tested positive for COVID-19\u00a0to be considered as donors. At this point, that means they need to have a confirmed positive test result, which, given the limitations on testing, significantly decreases the pool of possible donors.\nThat may change with the addition of\u00a0antibody testing to see who has COVID-19 antibodies, regardless of symptoms, in the weeks ahead. That will allow health professionals to find people who previously had COVID-19. But for now, the only way to be certain an individual had the virus and will have useful plasma is through a positive test.\n\"The only way that we can feel confident that the plasma that we're giving to patients is going to truly be able to help them is if we have positive confirmation that the donors were infected with COVID-19,\" she said.\nIndividuals must be symptom-free for 14 days and test negative for the virus to be considered to make sure the infection is completely out of their system. Their blood will also be screened for diseases such as HIV and hepatitis to make sure it's safe for recipients.\nThe Mayo Clinic is identifying patients and employees who have tested positive and recovered to be\u00a0potential donors. It has multiple donors identified and ready.\n\"Presumably, they've made very good antibodies because those antibodies have allowed them to beat the disease,\" Adamski said.\nAdamski said the response from the Mayo community has been \"amazing,\" with many recovered and recovering individuals eager to donate. \"It's just been really remarkable how the whole community is stepping up to the plate.\"\nAlthough Mayo is beginning with its own patients and staff because it has access to those positive test results, others are also eligible to donate through Vitalant.\nIndividuals who have tested positive can sign up directly on Vitalant's website . Individuals\u00a0can fill out a form here to volunteer as a donor.\nThe blood collection will take around 25 to 45 minutes, in addition to time for paperwork beforehand and eating afterward.\n\u201cAs this life-transforming program continues to expand, we\u2019re putting out a call to those who have recovered from COVID-19 to help patients in need,\u201d said Cliff Numark, Vitalant\u2019s chief of marketing, in a statement. \u201cWe encourage those who are eligible to go through the process to make a real difference.\u201d\nThe American Red Cross also has a plasma donation program based in Tucson. The organization hopes to expand it to Phoenix in the future, spokesman Colin Williams said.\nThose interested\u00a0can sign up to donate online at the Red Cross's plasma donation webpage . Donors must be at least 17 years old, at least 110 pounds and in good health. As with\u00a0Vitalant, potential plasma donors must have had a \"prior, verified\" COVID-19 diagnosis but are now symptom-free and fully recovered.\nThe Red Cross completed its first convalescent plasma donation for COVID-19 on April 12 in Tucson.\nPlasma for patient treatment\nAfter Vitalant collects the plasma from donors, the samples will be frozen and distributed to area hospitals like Mayo. They can then be thawed and given to patients as necessary.\nA donor\u00a0in one sitting can provide enough plasma for\u00a0five doses for up to five patients, Adamski said.\nFDA guidelines currently mandate plasma can\u00a0be used outside of clinical trials only for patients with \"serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19.\" Those include critically ill patients who have life-threatening infections and are likely intubated in the ICU, Adamski said.\nOther hospitals, like Mayo's Rochester headquarters, are doing clinical trials to treat patients with plasma before they become critically ill, such as patients who may be sick and in the hospital but not yet in the ICU.\nAdamski expects that if trials and treatment are successful, convalescent plasma will be used widely to treat COVID-19.\nShe said it can be used for patients who have the virus and\u00a0also \"in theory\" to protect individuals from getting the virus. Individuals at high risk who have come into contact with an infected person could be treated with plasma as a preventive measure.\nMayo Clinic has been leading a broader effort with several other academic institutions, the White House, the FDA and blood donor centers such as the American Red Cross to advance plasma as a possible treatment, Adamski said.\nTheir website www.uscovidplasma.org has a portal where physicians can request the plasma they need to treat patients and where potential donors can find donation locations.\nIf the treatment proves effective, the goal is to create a national repository of convalescent plasma to which\u00a0any health care provider across the county will have access, Adamski said.\nAnd plasma is not the only treatment in the works. Scientists, researchers and physicians are experimenting with a great number of methods to treat or cure COVID-19.\n\"It is unbelievable how many clinical trials there are in place,\" Adamski said. \"This is a very promising therapy, but there are many other drugs that are being looked at right now and clinical trials popping up every day.\"\nReach the reporter at Alison.Steinbach@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-444-4282.

Those without one will be provided one. People refusing to wear one will be asked to leave.\nSmoking on the floor, in bathrooms or public spaces will be prohibited. There will be designated smoking areas.\nHotels will be operated at 50 percent occupancy, and hotel rooms will be left unoccupied for at least 24 hours until they are thoroughly cleaned.\nRestaurants will be reconfigured to provide six feet between diners.

Steve Sisolak said Friday that it will be safe to vote in person this November, but he prefers that people to stay home and vote by mail or vote early to avoid big crowds at Election Day polling places.\nSisolak and other Democrats held a phone call with reporters where they defended a law the governor signed earlier this month to automatically mail ballots to the state's active voters ballots ahead of the November election, which President Donald Trump's campaign has challenged in court.\nThe governor and Nevada House Speaker Jason Frierson, who wrote the law, were asked if it's unsafe for people to vote in person.\n\"Absolutely not,\" Sisolak said. But he added, \"We prefer that people stay home, especially if you're in a vulnerable situation, you've got an underlying medical condition. You've got any symptoms of the virus, any of those sort of things.\"\nThe governor said he encourages people to stay home and to avoid crowds, and that's why he's encouraging people to vote early or vote by mail.\nMore: Nevada asks judge to dismiss Trump, GOP vote-by-mail lawsuit\nFrierson said he agreed with the governor that voting in person is \"absolutely safe.\"\n\"We'll continue to practice social distancing and wear masks to minimize exposure,\" he said.\nBy providing in-person, early voting and voting by mail this November, \"with all three options available for voters, we are doing it in the safest and most secure way possible,\" he said.\nNevada is among at least eight states that plan to automatically send voters mail ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic this year.\nTrump's campaign and the Republican Party filed a lawsuit over the new law, contending it would undermine the election's integrity. The president, though he has voted by mail himself, has raised unfounded fears in recent months about vote-by-mail leading to fraud, even though elections experts say fraud by any form of voting is rare.\nFrierson said he's confident Nevada's new law will withstand the court challenge and with the changes, \"barriers posed by the global pandemic are now easier to overcome.\"\n\"This gives more options and of course will hopefully reduce waits.\"\nOpinion: We need answers (and action) from the postmaster general, and we need them now | Rosen\nThe new law also requires at least 140 in-person polling locations in Nevada, including 100 in the Las Vegas area. That's comes after officials drastically cut in-person sites in the June primary, leading to lines as long as eight hours.\nNevada's Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske opposed Nevada's new law, saying her office did not have the budget for the changes, in addition to opposing changes to rules about who can collect ballots.\nShe has also said that the Democratically-controlled Legislature excluded her from discussions about the new law, showing her a draft of the bill a day before it was voted on in the state Assembly. After it passed, she requested Sisolak enact an emergency regulation allowing her office more oversight over provisions allowing third parties to collect and return multiple ballots, something critics derisively call \"ballot harvesting.\"\nSisolak rejected the request. On Friday, he and Frierson both pushed back on claims from the state's top elections official that she wasn't consulted. They said Cegavske was part of the process because she testified to the bill during a hearing and made her opposition known.\n\"Had she not been closed to the concept from the start, then, you know, maybe she would have been a little more assertive in trying to make suggestions,\" Frierson said. \"But we had hearings.\"\nMore: Sisolak rejects Cegavske's request for more oversight of 'ballot

a potential Covid-19 vaccine rollout by November 1, sparking concerns President Donald Trump's administration is rushing to begin distributing a vaccine before the November 3 elections.\nUnder normal procedures, test administrators must wait for months or years to verify that vaccine candidates work and are safe.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration however has raised the possibility that a vaccine might be given emergency authorisation before the end of trials.\nThe FDA has faced allegations from the medical community, which it has denied, that it is bowing to political pressure from Trump, who is trailing Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the polls.\n\"I understand also that they are sceptical... because there is so much politicisation (of) the science right now,\" Pfizer chief Bourla said.\nBut he stressed that \"we will never ourselves submit for authorisation or approval any vaccine before we feel it is safe and effective.\"\nBourla told journalists that more than 23,000 people were already enrolled in the trial, across 125 sites mainly in the United States and Brazil, and that the companies expected to reach the necessary 30,000 participants \"in a few days\".\nHe expected by the end of October \"to be able to have enough events to say if the programme works or not.\"\n- 'Very thorough process' -\nDaniel O'Day, head of Gilead, insisted that the process of obtaining an emergency use authorisation is no easy feat, pointing to his company's experience obtaining one for its antiviral drug remdesivir, which has been shown to be effective in treating Covid-19.\n\"It is a very thorough process,\" he noted.\nSeverin Schwan, head of Roche, said the industry had demonstrated its commitment to transparency in the data, and was dedicated to keeping testing standards high despite pressure for results.\nHe pointed to his company's disappointing findings that its arthritis drug tocilizumab -- sold under the brand name Actemra -- was not by itself an effective treatment for Covid-19, as anecdotal evidence had suggested.\n\"There is no way that we can lower the standards in conducting our trials,\" he said, adding that the Actemra trials \"demonstrate the very point.\"\nRoche is still testing whether Actemra could be effective when combined with other drugs, including Gilead's remdesivir.\nnl/rjm/wai"}, {"RECORDID": "20200707-29697",

No new hospitalizations or deaths were reported.\nDepartment of Health and Social Services Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink elaborated on a few of the cases and said two of the 10 new cases were out of Anchorage and three were in Fairbanks. Two cases came out of North Pole. In Juneau, one new case was confirmed, and there was one new case each in Ketchikan and Wasilla, Zink said. Of the individuals who tested positive, three were men, seven were women; one is between the ages of 19 to 29, eight are aged 30 to 59, and one is over the age of 60. Two of those who tested positive are considered close contacts of other confirmed cases, and none of the new cases are travel-related this time, according to DHSS.\nThe department also said that 5,022 people have been tested, with 2.8 percent testing positive.\nAlong with Gov. Mike Dunleavy's announcement that spring bear hunts across Alaska have been cancelled, multiple mandates surrounding public gathering spaces were also extended indefinitely on Wednesday. Mandate 3.1, which required that dine-in services such as those at bars and restaurants and social gathering areas like theaters and bowling alleys be halted, has been \"extended until rescinded.\" Libraries, archives and museums will be closed until further notice, though those entities may provide services online, according to DHSS' Adam Crum.\nCommissioner Michael Johnson of the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development provided an update on the statewide virtual school program. Johnson also said one of the latest developments is school districts are now able to provide non-communal meals to its students, which is being done in more than 40 communities across the state.\n\"Different districts have different capacities,\" he said, \"but it's been amazing to see how educators across the state have responded.\"\nDunleavy added that an update on equipment, statistics and modeling will happen on Thursday evening. He added that, unless there is a spike in cases, there likely will not be a press conference over the weekend.

One model predicts that Brazil will surpass the U.S. in coronavirus deaths in July.\nExperts have warned that the death toll in Brazil could be far higher than what's been reported. Gimena S\u00e1nchez-Garzoli, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA)'s director of the Andes, told CBS News in mid-June that she wouldn't \"trust\" the Brazilian government's reported figures, and blamed President Jair Bolsonaro for an unwillingness to act and a lack of transparency.\nBolsonaro takes the \"prize for the most disastrous combination of denial and lack of taking any measures,\" S\u00e1nchez-Garzoli said.

The situation has become so dire that the World Health Organization called South America the new epicenter of the global pandemic in late May.\nOther countries have been more successful in containing the virus. In China, the pandemic's original epicenter, officials reported no new cases on May 23. Although there has since been a small second outbreak linked to another food market, the nation has ramped up testing and said the quick response will likely pay off.\nIn Europe, which was hard-hit by the virus in its early months, countries are cautiously beginning to reopen .

They dressed wounds and saved lives at the main government hospital even as a nearby trauma center was bombed, killing more than 40 people.\nNow, about 70 doctors and nurses out of a staff of 361 at Kunduz Regional Hospital \u2014 the main health facility for several restive provinces in northeastern Afghanistan \u2014 are either infected with the coronavirus or in quarantine on suspicion of infection. But there is no choice but to keep the doors open, said Dr. Naeem Mangal, the hospital director. The doctors cannot reject the dozens of war wounded who continue to arrive each day, as fighting rages every night within earshot of the hospital.\n\u201cThe hospital needs to be quarantined, but what alternative do we have?\u201d Mangal said. \u201cIt has made us so concerned that we are all scared of each other at the hospital because we don\u2019t know who is infected and who isn\u2019t.\u201d\nAfghanistan\u2019s feeble health system \u2014 dependent on foreign donations even for the $5 per head the country spends annually on health, and reliant on nongovernmental organizations for the delivery of its most basic services \u2014 has been tested by the spread of the pandemic at a time when the war with the Taliban continues to rage nationwide.\nTesting remains extremely limited, but as of Friday, the country had recorded just over 2,300 cases, with at least 228 among medical workers, and 68 recorded deaths. There is a risk that hospital visits could actually be fueling the spread of the virus.\nOn Thursday, Afghanistan\u2019s health minister, Ferozuddin Feroz, said the spread of the virus has continued as predicted by WHO models, which suggested that more than half of the population could become infected.\n\u201cYesterday, we had 500 tests and about 232 turned out positive,\u201d said Feroz, a trauma surgeon during the country\u2019s bloody civil war in the 1990s. \u201cThat would suggest the infection is truly circulating in society.\u201d\nCiting the Spanish Flu, which lasted three years, Feroz said he feared an impoverished place like Afghanistan could be grappling with coronavirus not for months but years.\nThe government\u2019s ban on large gatherings and enforcement of some level of lockdown in major cities slowed the spread, he said, but too many people flouted those measures.\nSome Afghans have been swayed by religious leaders who are disregarding advisories and continuing to hold prayers of hundreds and sometimes thousands of people. Even the country\u2019s senate is refusing pleas to call off sessions and respect the government ban on large indoor gatherings.\nMore widely, the country\u2019s deep poverty, where people depend on wages they make working day to day, has made any strict enforcement of lockdowns impossible. One Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to brief a reporter, estimated that roughly 80 percent of the population already lived on less than $1.25 a day \u2014 just 25 cents more than the poverty line.\nThere are already widespread food shortages across the country. In Kabul, the government Wednesday started distributing bread to about 250,000 families through 1,200 bakeries across the city, with each family getting between 4 to 10 loaves per day, depending on the family size.\nTo fight hunger, the charity will be extended to other cities in coming days. But crowds outside bakeries on the first day of distribution raised concerns that the measure will also fuel the spread of the virus.\nA hospital in northern Faryab province, where fighting continues in several districts, might be forced to quarantine the ICU section of their only hospital, said the governor, Naqibullah Faiq.

(WMBF) - South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster has laid out strict social distancing guidelines as businesses reopen during the coronavirus pandemic, but what\u2019s not mandatory is wearing a face mask.\nAs seen over the Memorial Day weekend, social distancing on the beaches and the boardwalk area can be a bit difficult for some residents to maintain, which has some people wanting to know if wearing masks could help protect them from catching the virus.\nAccording to the medical experts, the biggest weapons in the fight against COVID-19 is washing your hands, using sanitizer and social distancing, but they say wearing a face mask or covering is another protection that can help stop the spread of the virus.\nThe Centers for Disease Control says wearing a face covering will help people who may have the virus but aren\u2019t aware of it. The face masks help to prevent the spread in the community, especially in places where it\u2019s difficult to maintain social distancing such as grocery stores.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and medical expert for the White House\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force, shared his thoughts on wearing a face mask as the country reopens.\n\u201cI certainly think we should be recommending it,\" Fauci said. \"I wear [a mask] whenever I\u2019m outside, I try to keep the usual distance but sometimes it\u2019s out of your control. I wear one for that reason, I believe it is effective. It\u2019s not 100% effective.\u201d\nDr. Paul Richardson, the chief medical officer for Conway Medical Center, said wearing a face mask could definitely make an impact with bending the curve, particularly for those who may be infected and don\u2019t know it.\n\u201cFor example, if I were shedding the virus right now, the mask could catch most of the droplets,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cLike [it would catch the droplets] as I speak, cough or sneeze. We believe the droplets are one way the virus is transmitted. So theoretically, if I catch those droplets before they land on a surface, or get airborne, that should reduce my risk of infecting others.\u201d\nRichardson said a big misconception many people have about wearing a face mask, is that it prevents them from catching the virus. The doctor said that\u2019s not the case.\n\u201cWith these particular types of masks, that\u2019s not true,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThis does not 100% protect the wearer from not contracting anything, but it can reduce the risk of the wearer spreading something. So obviously if enough people wear masks, we cut down significantly on our risk of spreading it around.\u201d\nRichardson said right now, it\u2019s hard to know for sure if a second wave of this virus is probable during the reopening phases. But he said wearing a protective covering can definitely help with reducing the COVID-19 spread.\nNumerous businesses are implementing the governor\u2019s social distancing guidelines while encouraging their guests to take safety precautions inside their facilities.\nRick Sarver, an employee at Boardwalk Coffee House, located right along the beach, said he welcomes customers to take safety precautions, however it best suits them.\n\u201cSome customers are coming in with masks,\u201d Sarver said. \u201cIf they feel comfortable wearing a mask, wear a mask, if they don\u2019t then don\u2019t wear a mask.

The state of Israel has never had diplomatic relations with the Gulf Arab countries, and this type of normalization has long been sought by both the Israeli and U.S. governments. Other Sunni Arab governments may soon follow: the U.A.E. is a regional leader and close ally of Saudi Arabia. While the exact role of the U.S. in facilitating this deal is still unclear, it does appear to be a rare diplomatic win for the Trump administration, and one that may have been made possible by the administration\u2019s close ties to both governments.\nNow, those caveats. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described today\u2019s announcement as a \u201csignificant step forward for peace in the Middle East.\u201d It would be more accurate to say it\u2019s a step in the solidification of the region\u2019s fault lines. Iran was not mentioned in today\u2019s statement, but it\u2019s very much the backdrop of all of this. As analyst Karim Sadjadpour quipped , \u201cCongratulations to Iran for helping to midwife the normalization of relations between the UAE and Israel.\u201d\nGiven that the Trump administration\u2019s strategy toward Iran is regime change in all but name, the fact that it\u2019s getting all its allies in line behind that strategy is, I suppose, a diplomatic achievement. Rather than a \u201cstep forward for peace,\u201d it could make armed conflict more likely, not less, particularly if Trump returns to office next year.\nThe announcement more or less just makes official what\u2019s been obvious for some time now: The Sunni Arab monarchies may condemn Israel in public, but they are tacitly allied in a regional conflict with Iran. The governments view that conflict as a bigger priority than Israel\u2019s occupation of the Palestinian Territories, though they\u2019ve been reluctantly to say it publicly and risk backlash. A leaked 2017 Israeli diplomatic cable revealed that the Israeli government was instructing its diplomats to support Saudi Arabia\u2019s criticism of Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah. A video clip posted by the Israeli government last year showed the foreign ministers of three Arab countries defending Israel and criticizing Iran at a conference in Poland. \u201cWe grew up talking about the Israel-Palestine issue as the most important issue\u2026But then, at a later stage, we saw a bigger challenge, we saw a more toxic one \u2014 in fact the more toxic one in our history \u2014 that came from the Islamic Republic,\u201d said the Bahraini foreign minister. (The clip was quickly taken down.)\nHaving a common enemy is one thing. Admitting that you\u2019re friends is another. This distinction was clear in June when Israel announced a partnership with the UAE to combat the coronavirus, which Emirati officials quickly doused with cold water .\nArab governments may not care all that much about the plight of the Palestinians anymore, but their citizens do, and today\u2019s announcement would not have happened if the Israeli government had gone ahead with plans to annex large portions of the West Bank on July 1. In June, the UAE\u2019s influential ambassador to the U.S., Yousef al-Otaiba, took the unusual step of publishing an op-ed in Hebrew in an Israeli newspaper warning that annexation would be a setback in efforts to improve relations between the two countries. Today\u2019s announcement notes that \u201cat the request of President Trump\u2026Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined in the President\u2019s Vision for Peace.\u201d\nOne group that will not be happy about this is the Israeli far right, which cares about the settlements far more than relations with the UAE. Some officials are already emphasizing that the annexation announcement has only been suspended rather than abandoned.\nFor Palestinians, this probably won\u2019t change all that much, other than underlining the already-known fact that many of their regional allies are growing weary of the Palestinian issue. It will also be another blow to the already rickety two-state solution framework for Middle East peace if the Arab governments that have supported it move on.\nFor Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this is a much-needed win at a time when he\u2019s facing large public protests over corruption allegations, the state of the economy, and his handling of the coronavirus. While not as symbolically important for his supporters as annexation, it\u2019s also a lot less risky and controversial. This may have been the best possible outcome for him, politically.\nAs for Trump, the deal may not actually do that much to shore up his pro-Israel bona fides\u2014right-wing American Jews and Christian Zionists probably would have preferred annexation\u2014but he\u2019ll no doubt use it to tout himself as a dealmaker and peacemaker. Just in case you thought they might underplay this one, National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien noted in a press conference on Thursday, that Trump, after all, wrote The Art of the Deal, and suggested he would eventually be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.\nWest Wing ego-stroking aside, it\u2019s true that suspending annexation is a concession from Israel, but the only reason annexation has been on the table at all is because there was some reason to believe Trump might support it, including the \u201cVision for Peace,\u201d the Jared Kushner-masterminded peace plan that would have eviscerated Palestinian sovereignty in the West Bank. It\u2019s another example of the approach to international diplomacy previously seen in Syria and North Korea : His rhetoric contributed to a crisis\u2014potential annexation\u2014and he\u2019s now taking credit after things return to the status quo.\nViewed in a vacuum, today\u2019s announcement is a significant development. Viewed as the main, perhaps sole, outcome of Trump and Kushner\u2019s to reach the \u201cultimate deal\u201d for Middle East peace, it looks pretty paltry."}, {"RECORDID": "20200817-74368", "label": -1, "title": "Two Democrats call for criminal inquiry of postmaster general", "body": "Two Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee on Monday called for FBI Director Christopher Wray to open a criminal probe into Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, accusing him of deliberately slowing the mail to give President Trump an advantage in the November presidential election.\n\"There is overwhelming evidence that Postmaster General DeJoy and the Board of Governors have hindered the passage of mail,\" Reps.

Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his historic \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d address, a vision of racial equality that remains elusive for millions of Americans.\nAnd they are gathering on the heels of yet another shooting by a white police officer of a Black man \u2014 this time, 29-year-old Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last Sunday \u2014 sparking days of protests and violence that left two dead.\n\u201cI want to give space for Black people in the crowd to say they are not OK,\u201d said Jumaane Williams, New York City\u2019s public advocate, who addressed march attendees shortly after the program began.\n\u201cWe are like the nameless grandmothers who got in the streets and said, \u2018We will make you live up to what America says she is,\u2019\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe are here.

Because I\u2019m tired,\u201d Nitty said. \u201cThey think this is a negotiation, but I came here to demand change. My grandson ain\u2019t gonna march for the same things that my granddaddy marched for.

Many attendees showed up wearing T-shirts bearing the image and words of the late Rep. John Lewis who, until his death last month, was the last living speaker at the original March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which went on to become one of the most famous political rallies in U.S. history, and one of the largest gatherings at the nation\u2019s capital with over 200,000 people advocating for social change.\nParticipants streaming in for the march late Friday morning stood in lines that stretched for several blocks, as organizers insisted on taking temperatures as part of coronavirus protocols. Organizers reminded attendees to practice social distancing and wear masks throughout the program.\nMartin Luther King III, a son of the late civil rights icon and the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose civil rights organization, the National Action Network, planned Friday\u2019s event, delivered keynote addresses that show the urgency for federal policing reforms, to decry racial violence, and to demand voting rights protections ahead of the November general election.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to bear witness, to remain awake, to remember from where we\u2019ve come and to carefully consider where we\u2019re going,\u201d King said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re here in person or watching on (television networks), thank you for joining us for this March on Washington.\u201d\n\"We\u2019re taking a step forward on America\u2019s rocky but righteous journey toward justice,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just come out here to have a show,\" Sharpton said. \"Demonstration without legislation will not lead to change.\u201d\nAnd to underscore the urgency, Sharpton assembled the families of an ever-expanding roll call of victims: Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, and Eric Garner, among others.\nVideo: Breonna Taylor's mother speaks during March on Washington\nArbery and Martin both were killed by white men who pursued them with guns.\nFollowing the commemorative rally, participants will march to the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial in West Potomac Park, next to the National Mall, and then disperse.\nTurnout in Washington was expected to be lighter than initially intended due to city-imposed coronavirus pandemic restrictions that limit out-of-state visitors to the nation\u2019s capital. To that end, the National Action Network organized a handful of satellite march events in South Carolina, Florida and Nevada, among others.\nRobbie Williams, 67, traveled to the march from Covington, Kentucky, and said attending was her way of \u201cspeaking to my children and my people.\u201d\n\u201cMy message to my children is to stand up no matter what. And to the police: get some education and read your bibles,\u201d Williams said, adding that she also wants Black communities to honestly confront internal violence and homophobia.\nRepresentation of Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and gender-nonconforming people in the movement was addressed by several march speakers, including David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, a Black LGBTQ civil rights organization.\n\u201cI stand here in the spirit of our brother Bayard Rustin,\u201d he said, referring to the King adviser who helped organize the original march. \u201cWithout his brilliance and his commitment to our intersectional social justice, there would not have been a March on Washington.\u201d\n\u201cIf you care about Black people like I do, if you love Black people like I do, you\u2019ve got to love and care about all of us,\u201d Johns said.\nWhile participants march in Washington, Sharpton has called for those in other states to march on their U.S. senators\u2019 offices and demand their support of federal policing reforms. Sharpton said protesters should also demand reinvigorated U.S. voter protections, in Lewis' memory.\nIn June, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act, which would ban police use of stranglehold maneuvers and end qualified immunity for officers, among other reforms. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after a white police officer in Minneapolis held a knee to the man\u2019s neck for nearly eight minutes, sparking weeks of sustained protests and unrest from coast to coast.\nIn July, following Lewis\u2019 death, Democratic senators reintroduced legislation that would restore a provision of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013. The law previously required states with a history of voter suppression to seek federal clearance before changing voting regulations.\nBoth measures are awaiting action in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nIn her remarks at the march, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, whose Texas district includes Floyd's hometown of Houston, referenced a line from the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d address that decries America for giving Black people \u201ca bad check, a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.'\u201d\n\u201cToday, we stop the insufficient funds and we put money in the bank,\u201d Lee said, vowing to keep pushing for enactment of the federal legislation.\nLater in the evening, the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 Black-led organizations that make up the broader Black Lives Matter movement, will hold its virtual Black National Convention.\nThe convention will coincide with the unveiling of a new Black political agenda intended to build on the success of this summer\u2019s protests. The platform will deepen calls for defunding police departments in favor of investments to healthcare, education, housing and other social services in Black communities, organizers said.\n___\nAaron Morrison reported from New York.

That was on Jan. 30. Now, just months later, it\u2019s over $14 and shows no signs of slowing.\nWith a desperate need for a coronavirus vaccine, I only expect to see higher highs in the Inovio stock. All as the coronavirus continues to wreak global havoc, infecting nearly 4.4 million people around the world. In the U.S., the number of infected is more than 1.5 million. Over in Russia, the number of infections is up to 290,000.

If results are as solid as the world hopes, I strongly believe the INO could quickly race to $20.\nAfter its vaccine candidate demonstrated strong animal study results, Inovio Pharmaceuticals now hopes to see solid success in human trials, as well. So far, the company has enrolled 40 healthy volunteers in Phase 1 trials, and expects to post preliminary data by late June 2020.\nPatients will receive two doses of the vaccine four weeks apart. If results are as solid as the animal studies, it may be able to move to Phase 2/3 trials by summer, pending approval. The company is also in Phase 1/2 human trials for the vaccine in South Korea after receiving $6.9 million in funding from the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI).\nIt\u2019s also working with Beijing Advaccine Biotechnology to create a vaccine in China, as well. In fact, according to the company, \u201cInovio will leverage Advaccine\u2019s expertise to conduct a Phase 1 trial in\u00a0China\u00a0in parallel with Inovio\u2019s clinical development efforts in the U.S. and\u00a0South Korea.\u201d\nBetter, the trials are well funded. To date, CEPI has awarded Inovio more than $17.2 million, according to the company. The Department of Defense also gave it and Ology Bioservices $11.9 million for rapid production of the Inovio vaccine. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also backed Inovio with a $5 million grant to accelerate testing.\nWhile we wait on human trial results, there are other big reasons to like the INO stock. In announcing first-quarter earnings, INO President and CEO J. Joseph Kim, spoke glowingly of the company\u2019s other efforts.\n\u201cMost importantly, while safely conducting global clinical trials during this COVID pandemic has been a significant challenge, INOVIO is on track to deliver key 2020 clinical and regulatory milestones including the planned reporting of REVEAL 1 Phase 3 top-line efficacy data for VGX-3100 in Q4 and the presentation of 12-month overall survival results from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INO-5401 immunotherapy in a very hard to treat cancer in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) at the ASCO20 Virtual Conference later this month.\u201d\nIts VGX-3100 treatment just saw positive interim data in Phase 2 clinical trials in precancerous and vulvar dysplasias. And its INO-3107 just advanced to Phase 1/2 clinical trials to help treat rare orphan disease recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP).\nThe company is also in Phase 2 trials for INO-5151 for prostate cancer, Phase 2 trials of MEDi0457 for the treatment of neck and head cancer, and Phase 2 trials of INO-5401 for the treatment of glioblastoma.\nIn short, even when the coronavirus becomes a distant memory, and stocks like INO begin to pull back on the death of news, Inovio Pharmaceutical is not a one-trick pony. At the moment, I strongly believe INO is a strong buy on the coronavirus story.\nIf all goes well in human trials, $20 a share may be very low estimate.\nIan Cooper, a contributor to\u00a0InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\u00a0As of this writing, Ian Cooper did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities."}, {"RECORDID": "20200803-67808", "label": -1, "title": "Colleges reverse course on reopening as pandemic continues", "body": "With the fall semester fast approaching and coronavirus infections still rampant, numerous colleges and universities nationwide are reversing course and abandoning plans to bring students back to campus.\nLast week George Washington University, Georgetown University, and American University, all in the Washington, D.C., area, announced that they would be almost entirely online in the fall, backing away from previously announced plans to offer in-person classes. Two weeks ago, three historically Black universities in the Atlanta area \u2014 Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, and Morehouse College \u2014 announced they would start the semester online, after previously saying they would bring a portion of their students back to campus and teach both in-person and online.\nOther universities that have switched gears include the University of California Berkeley and Miami University in Ohio, which both recently announced their fall semesters will start with all classes online. Both had previously planned to teach some classes in-person.\nSince mid-July, the University of Delaware, Pepperdine University in California, and Dickinson College in Pennsylvania have all moved their fall semester online with only a small number of students allowed to live on campus, after initially announcing plans for on-campus classes.\nIn the Boston area, only Berklee College of Music has announced plans to change course and offer classes exclusively online, after preparing for a hybrid model in June.\nSome of the largest higher education institutions in the region, including Boston University, Northeastern University, and Tufts University, said they have testing and public health precautions in place and are sticking with their plans to bring students back to campus and provide both online and in-person instruction.\n\u201cWe are moving cautiously and carefully ahead with the plans we announced in June,\u201d said Renata Nyul, a spokeswoman for Northeastern. \u201cNortheastern has undertaken countless extraordinary measures to plan for a safe fall semester.

Many students want to return to campus after months of isolation and many are skeptical about the online learning experience. Colleges are also loath to lose out on the room and board revenue from students.\nBut with much of the country still in the throes of the pandemic, states implementing stricter quarantine measures for out-of-state visitors, and growing resistance from faculty and staff, along with neighbors, colleges are being forced to reconsider their plans.\nMore than 154,000 people in the United States have died from coronavirus, and in some parts of the country the number of infections is trending upward. Last week, Massachusetts required visitors from high-risk states, including college students, to quarantine for 14 days .\nSome town and city officials and residents who live near campuses or close to apartments rented by students have urged Massachusetts institutions to reconsider their reopening plans. More than 1,000 Amherst residents have signed on to a petition asking the University of Massachusetts Amherst to keep students away. UMass Amherst plans to bring a smaller number of students back to campus, although most classes will be online.\nGeorgetown in early July had planned to bring 2,000 undergraduates, including first-year students, back, but by the end of the month decided the plan was no longer feasible.\nGeorgetown president John J. DeGioia cited quarantine restrictions as one of several factors that forced the school to teach online.\n\u201cDue to the acceleration of the spread of the virus and increasing restrictions on interstate travel, we cannot proceed with our original plans for returning to campus this fall,\u201d DeGioia wrote in a letter to families.\nThe decision to change course was \u201cexcruciating\u201d said Roger Brown, president of Berklee College.\nBut with many of Berklee\u2019s students coming from California, where the number of infections are spiking, and increasing reluctance by faculty to teach in-person, planning to bring students back in the fall became increasingly challenging.\nAnd due to the likely spread of the coronavirus through aerosol particles, it would have been much more difficult for vocalists and musicians who play wind instruments to perform together, Brown said.\n\u201cWe were not sure we can guarantee the safety of our students, our staff, and our faculty, and we\u2019re also not sure we can ensure the safety of the people in the community,\u201d Brown said.\nThe college was planning to spend $8 million to $10 million on testing and safety equipment and now will put that money toward $2,500 grants for all students to upgrade their technology and other needs since they will be staying at home, Brown said.\nOther universities that have switched to exclusively online are offering students small tuition discounts.\nBrown acknowledged that Berklee will be forgoing millions in room and board fees.\n\u201cI\u2018m confident that we will come out of this in good shape, but we will definitely take a financial hit from this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with the decision, but I\u2019ll be the first to say, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right or not.

A Financial Times article published on Sunday reported that the Trump administration was considering fast-tracking the COVID-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford.\nOn one hand, it doesn't make sense why investors would sell off Novavax shares on worries about another COVID-19 vaccine making it to market sooner. After all, Novavax only started a phase 2 clinical study of its coronavirus vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373 yesterday. Several drugmakers are already in phase 3 testing with their COVID-19 vaccine candidates. No one expected Novavax to be the first to market with its vaccine.\nHowever, Novavax's market cap of around $6.6 billion is still pretty steep considering the company doesn't have any approved product on the market yet. Any news that could be construed as bad in any way for its prospects is likely to cause the biotech stock to fall. That's what we've seen happen this week.\nAAPL\nSTZ\nTSLA\nAMZN\nThese downswings are merely noise, though. The important thing to watch with Novavax is how NVX-CoV2373 performs in phase 2 testing.\nNovavax plans to enroll up to 1,500 healthy volunteers in its phase 2 study at as many as 40 sites in the U.S. and Australia. Roughly half of those participants will be ages 60 and older. That's important since older individuals are at greater risk with COVID-19.

Having learned little from the under-attended event which was both a political and public-health disaster, Trump on Sunday hosted a campaign rally indoors during an airborne pandemic, this time at a facility owned by Xtreme Manufacturing in Henderson, Nevada, southeast of Las Vegas.\nOnce again, public-health experts and local politicians decried a president who has downplayed the threat of a pandemic which has killed close to 200,000 Americans for bringing his supporters together in violation of the state\u2019s restriction on gatherings of 50 people or more. National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins  said late last week that he was \u201cpretty puzzled\u201d and rather disheartened by the president\u2019s indoor choice. Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, went a little further in an interview on CNN, comparing the act to \u201cnegligent homicide.\u201d Reiner added, \u201cIf you have a mass gathering now in the United States in a place like Nevada or just about any other place with hundreds of thousands of people, people will get infected and some of those people will die.\u201d\nGovernor Steve Sisolak also condemned Trump for the rally, stating that he \u201cis taking reckless and selfish actions that are putting countless lives in danger here in Nevada.\u201d On Twitter , Sisolak also claimed that state officials reiterated \u201cto the venues the existing restrictions\u201d in place in the state. \u201cThis is an insult to every Nevadan who has followed the directives, made sacrifices, and put their neighbors before themselves,\u201d he added . \u201cIt\u2019s also a direct threat to all of the recent progress we\u2019ve made, and could potentially set us back.\u201d\nThe rally was expected to be held at an airport hangar, as most of Trump\u2019s recent gatherings have been, until the initially-chosen venues dropped out because event violated Nevada\u2019s capacity limit. Ultimately, the forklift company Xtreme was chosen due to their apparent willingness to defy state recommendations and a direct warning from the city of Henderson. As CNN noted , \u201cthe owner of Xtreme, Don Ahern, also owns a Las Vegas hotel which was fined after it hosted an August \u2018Evangelicals for Trump\u2019 campaign event that exceeded the state limit and also violated some city health restrictions.\u201d And as Brian Stelter reported , major networks including CNN, ABC, and Fox News did not send their crews and correspondents inside the warehouse.\nAt the rally itself, attendees were given temperature checks before admission and masks were given out, though those in the building were not required to wear face coverings.\nThe site in Henderson: very little social distancing, very few masks. But there are forklifts pic.twitter.com/6qK1LwEbl3\nLike most Trump rallies, the main attraction was a greatest-hits mix of MAGA themes interrupted by a few new developments. The Green New Deal would cost $100 trillion, \u201cmore than we could make in a thousand years.\u201d In response to a condemnation of President Obama, the crowd improvised on a chant classic, yelling, \u201cLock him up.\u201d Tailoring his comments on athletes\u2019 physiques to the local pastime, he spent several minutes talking about MMA fighters. \u201cUnder those beautiful suits are a lot of muscle, a lot of power, lot of genius,\u201d the president said. \u201cFor fighting and for other things. Lot of genius under those suits.\u201d The only time he commented directly on the indoor nature of the event was when he dismissed Sisolak\u2019s warnings: \u201cIf the governor comes after you, which he shouldn\u2019t be doing, I\u2019ll be with you all the way.\u201d\nLike Trump\u2019s last indoor rally, the consequences of the event won\u2019t immediately be known. Similar to the June rally that \u201clikely\u201d resulted in a local COVID-19 uptick, according to the Tulsa City-County Health Department director, it\u2019s possible that the Nevada event will result in an increase in cases, considering that the state\u2019s positive testing rate currently sits at 8.51 percent , well above the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendations for reopening. According to Georgia Tech\u2019s COVID-19 Event Risk Assessment Planning Tool , the likelihood that at least one attendee at a 100-person gathering in Clark County, Nevada, would have the coronavirus is 92 percent. The last indoor rally \u2014 which was considered poorly-attended \u2014 had an audience of around 6,200 people."}, {"RECORDID": "20200628-16896", "label": 0, "title": "Tracking COVID-19: Comparing Taylor County to other West Texas counties", "body": "In the early months of the coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, Abilene/Taylor County was well ahead of other West Texas counties of similar size in the number of COVID-19 cases.\nJust as much about the novel coronavirus is unclear, knowing the \"why\" behind the numbers tracking rates of infection is a challenge, said\u00a0Dr. Anna Drachenberg, medical director for the Abilene Taylor County Public Health District.\nSince the pandemic's start\u00a0in the area in late March until early June, the number of COVID-19 cases in Taylor County (pop. 139,457) was outpacing the number in nearby Tom Green County (pop. 123,276), where San Angelo is the county seat.\nFor example, on June 1, Taylor County had 236 cases, compared to 70 in Tom Green, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services COVID-19 website. (Tom Green public health officials report a higher number of cases daily because they\u00a0process tests and track data for adjacent counties and include those figures.)\nIn June, Taylor County started\u00a0seeing a decline in the number of new cases, while Tom Green County experienced a noticeable uptick. But Taylor County still leads, as of Tuesday, with 313 cases to Tom Green's 201.\nLatest COVID-19 numbers: Saturday update for Abilene, Taylor County, the Big Country\nSeveral factors could be contributing to Abilene's outpacing other cities early in the illness, said Drachenberg in mid-May. On May 7, Taylor County had more than three times the number of positive cases (206) as compared to Tom Green County (58).\nDrachenberg said one possible factor was the number of tests being conducted locally. At one point, Taylor County was \"testing more compared to the rest of the state in general, based on the number of tests that are reported,\" Drachenberg said.\nMore tests means finding more cases of the illness, especially in asymptomatic individuals.\nOther factors for a community's COVID-19 infection rate, Drachenberg said, can include population density, percent of employment in industry versus agriculture, proximity to major highways with more people traveling through and extent of air travel.\nUntil May 6,\u00a0Abilene health officials were reporting positive cases based both on a\u00a0polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nasal swab test\u00a0and a quick antibody blood, or serology,\u00a0test.\u00a0 On that day, the number of confirmed cases reported by the county was 378.\nState health officials early in the pandemic gave\u00a0local public health officials general guidance on how to use serology tests to detect and isolate people with the illness, but none on how to report serology test results, Drachenberg said.\n\"We assumed if we said, well, this defines a probable case and those kinds of things, that's something the community and the state would want to know,\" Drachenberg said.\nBecause of variances in reliability in PCR and antibody tests, state officials later notified the Abilene\u00a0public health district that new cases would be calculated based on lab-confirmed\u00a0PCR tests only for uniformity across counties, Drachenberg said.\nMore: Coronavirus: Saturday update for Abilene, Taylor County, the Big Country\nTaylor County then adjusted its total number of confirmed cases, backing out 82 patients whose COVID-19 confirmation came from serology tests.\nThe county also deleted 94 Middleton and Robertson inmates who tested positive for COVID-19 because the prisons are inside Jones County.\nPrior to the adjustment, the prisoners testing positive were being reported twice to the state because they were tallied in both Jones and Taylor counties.\nMore: COVID-19 Updates: Taylor County numbers drop to 206 with removal of prison, antibody cases\nDealing with many unknown variables associated with the\u00a0novel coronavirus is frustrating for Drachenberg, who is also a family physician.\nShe said she is used to developing relationships with her patients and their families, which is helpful in discussing test results and health conditions. Medical tests are not always 100 percent accurate and absolute, she said.\nThrough face-to-face talks, doctors and patients develop a trust about how a physician made a diagnosis that is based on more than test results.\nSuch personal conversations are not viable\u00a0when addressing an entire community about a public health issue, she said.\nAnd, the newness of COVID-19 meant that early in the pandemic, local public health officials often were\u00a0relying on models and projections based on the illness's behavior elsewhere.\n\"We didn't have any better tools to predict what was going to happen than what the rest of the country was using,\" Drachenberg said about Abilene's preparations during the early days of the pandemic.\nThe first test-confirmed COVID-19 case in the state, in Fort Bend County, was reported March 4 by the Texas Department of Health Services.\nTaylor County's first two cases, unrelated to each other, were announced March 26.\nThe county's first death attributed to COVID-19 was reported April 4.\nMore: Second Taylor County COVID-19 patient dies \nThe newness of COVID-19 made understanding its spread, infection rate and disease progression a challenge.\u00a0Local health officials were forced to extrapolate how COVID-19 would affect Taylor County and the Big Country based on data on patients in urban areas.\n\"What we struggled to find in models was the impact on rural communities,\" Drachenberg said. \"We had to do what the rest of the country was doing\u00a0and take the models to give us 'worst-case scenarios,' so we could plan for that.\"\nBased on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health officials adopted a \"flatten the curve\" strategy to slow the expected rate of COVID-19 infections.\nSocial distancing measures were intended to slow the spread of the disease\u00a0to guard hospitals from being overwhelmed with a rush of patients.\nA slower rate of infection, the theory went, would enable hospitals to have the beds, supplies and staff necessary\u00a0to treat COVID-19 patients.\nEven with social distancing measures, some early models on potential\u00a0COVID-19 infection rates were alarming.\n\"Some of the models predicted that even if we utilized mitigation strategies to 'flatten the curve,' that COVID deaths for Taylor County could have been in the hundreds or\u00a0more,\" she said.\nOthers are reading: Hendrick CEO: Abilene hospital has 'plenty of capacity' now for COVID-19 cases\nAs of Tuesday,\u00a0the number of deaths in the county is five.\nThose early models also projected that hospitals could be overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.\n\"There were not a lot of concrete projects about what would happen if we did social distancing, only estimates, but some models showed that it could take the infection rate of a population from around 80% to 30%,\" Drachenberg said.\nHaving enough personal protective equipment for medical personnel was another concern, she said.\n\"Even before we got our first case of COVID-19 in our area, PPE was becoming extremely difficult to come by,\" Drachenberg said.\nContrary to many of the initial models, Abilene's experience with COVID-19, so far, has been manageable, with hospitalizations remaining low, she said.\n\"If the overall goal of this was to save lives ... and not to let this get so out of control that people are going to suffer\u00a0from COVID-19 unnecessarily because there was not a hospital bed or a ventilator \u2013\u00a0we have accomplished that. We continue to accomplish that. And, that is the good news,\" Drachenberg said.\nDr. Jay Butler, CDC deputy director for infectious diseases, recognized in a June 12 media teleconference\u00a0Americans' desire to return to the rhythms of life pre-COVID-19.\n\"As we live \u2013\u00a0as we head into the summer months, we know that Americans will be looking forward to reconnecting with family and friends and be able to attend events, and we want that to occur as safely as possible,\" he said.\nThe CDC continues to recommend three measures to stem the spread of COVID-19: social distancing, hand hygiene\u00a0and wearing a face covering in public.\nButler also offered a practical \"rule of thumb\" on how to practice those measures while returning to public life.\nKeep reading: City of Abilene says it will rely on TABC to enforce latest governor's order\n\"The more closely you interact with others, the longer the interaction lasts and the greater the number of people involved in the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread,\" he said. \"Understanding these risks and how to adopt different prevention measures can help you protect yourselves and others against the virus.\"\nAs Texas emerges from COVID-19 lockdown, the statewide numbers for daily new cases and hospitalizations has been trending higher. For example, on May 6, the number of active cases in the state was 15,672. On Tuesday, it was 47,436.\nHow COVID-19 affects Taylor County in the upcoming months is difficult to predict, Drachenberg said, because it\u00a0has exhibited qualities that are both similar and dissimilar to other\u00a0viruses and coronaviruses.\n\"Different viruses have their seasons, but we don't know what that season is going to look like until we're able to look at it over months to years,\" she said.\nBut, she is optimistic.\n\"I'm hopeful that when it's all said and done that all of those things that we hoped about it are eventually going to dissipate and that the year 2021 is not going to be defined by this,\" she said.\nThis article originally appeared on Abilene Reporter-News: Tracking COVID-19: Comparing Taylor County to other West Texas counties"}, {"RECORDID": "20200319-46338", "label": -1, "title": "Sick and concerned: Arizonans talk about their coronavirus experience", "body": "Our Arizona\u00a0community is hurting right now.

She was struggling to breathe, was admitted to the hospital, and said the workers who treated her wore full-bodied personal protective equipment.\nIn addition to breathing problems, her symptoms included a dry, non-productive cough and a sore throat. But the worst part was the breathing. It felt as though her lungs were on fire, she said.\nThe hospital is following state testing guidelines that say severely ill people should be tested but only if other respiratory illnesses have been ruled out, Parker said \u2014 a fact Banner officials confirmed with The Arizona Republic, though they stressed they cannot comment on individual cases due to patient privacy.\nParker tested positive for rhinovirus, and so her COVID-19 test was never processed, she said.\n\u201cA rhinovirus is like a cold.

Asa Hutchinson said a statewide survey was done in Arkansas, to gauge public attitudes towards wearing masks. In this survey, 82% of the participants stated they wear masks in public. 16% of the respondents answered no to wearing masks in public, and 2% failed to give a response. Of those who answered no, most said they didn't believe masks were effective.\nHutchinson went on to detail an executive order he signed giving cities the option to mandate the requirement of masks in public places.\nThe Arkansas Municipal League drafted the ordinance for the governor. It entails language that allows cities to require masks, but no penalties or arrests can be made for those who choose not to wear one.\nThis executive order allows for:\nWatch Live: Gov.

It's Friday, July 17.\nEditor's Note.\nAs I did a quick scan of all the incoming news on COVID-19 that I read every early morning, I saw this tragic story of Hortencia Laurens dying in Florida. Laurens was 70 years old and preparing for the annual family vacation on Florida's west coast. Like so many others that the novel coronavirus brings down, she began to feel ill, tried to seek help from Florida's over-burdened health care system, and died just a few days later in the arms of her daughter.\nYes, there are reports that the lethality of COVID-19 is not what it was just a few months ago, because as former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb shared on CNBC this morning, we are getting better at treating patients. The survivability of those placed on ventilators, which used to be a likely death sentence for most early in the pandemic, had a survival rate of 20 percent. Now that figure is closer to 70 percent. But Laurens couldn't get in the hospital and she died.\nIt doesn't have to be this way. It didn't have to be this way. Reading these stories is heartbreaking because unlike most political debates, public policy decisions are either really saving people or really killing people.\nAs I read about Laurens, I pondered whether we will move from stories like her death to a different reality someday. Will a future 70-year-old brought down by the coronavirus be quickly helped by therapeutics that help with their respiratory distress, or by vaccines that quickly crowd out the spiked proteins on the virus so the damage stops and the person's health can rebound? Will this nightmare be easily fixed? Or will those who are dying continue to be the tapestry of our morning reading?\nI lost many friends to AIDS during that crisis in the 1980s and 1990s. They were here with me and then they were gone. Eligio Crespo was one of those in my life. And then there were a mix of drug cocktails that added to longevity and kept the virus in check - and now there are daily drugs like Truvada to prevent infection. That was a long time coming, but progress happened.\nAIDS activist Larry Kramer used to hound and haunt Anthony Fauci to get him and his colleagues to speed up the research and drug discovery and testing process. Fauci did that and saved millions of lives by creating a more responsive drug development system. And I believe that Fauci is doing exactly the same thing today.\nBut who is screaming for Hortencia Laurens today and the many others dying? Too much of government at both the federal level and in many states seems to be shrugging off these infections and deaths. America has a flat-earth problem, and that along with killing this virus and moving past the pandemic is going to require some serious work in the future.\nLet's remember Hortencia Laurens and others out there who are suffering. They deserve respect, remembrance and better than they are getting now from us.\n- Steve Clemons\nYour Coronavirus Report team includes Steve Clemons , editor-at-large of The Hill, and researcher Andrew Wargofchik .

It\u2019s just a desperate situation, and far more dire than anything seen in decades.\u201d\nRepresentatives for media companies have been gearing up a lobbying effort for the plan aimed at expanding federal advertising spending to between $5 billion and $10 billion for the rest of the year, according to executives who have been involved in the developing the proposal but were not authorized to discuss the details.\nThe federal government was expected to lay out as much as $2 billion in ad spending this year, with additional dollars allocated to encourage participation in the 2020 census. The NAB will ask for spending on pandemic-related ads that instruct citizens on how to get back to work safely, social distancing and wearing masks.\nThe extra money could also finance more commercials and print ads for military recruitment and information on other government programs.\nThe proposal has bipartisan support from 74 U.S. senators and 124 House representatives, who cite the work that local media have done in their communities to keep the public informed on the pandemic.\n\u201cOur radio and television broadcasters and rural newspapers provide local and national news, emergency alerts, educational programs, and more to all corners of the United States. In many rural areas, broadcast stations are the predominant or only form of local information,\u201d the senators wrote on April 23 in a joint letter to the Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Russell Vought.\nThe letter asked that the office \u201cwork with federal agencies throughout the government to increase advertising in local newspapers and on broadcast stations in order to help ensure they are able to continue to operate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nThe proposal is designed to minimize the perception of the funds being a handout to media companies, as the government will be getting commercials and ads in return. While large media conglomerates such as the Walt Disney Company, Comcast and Fox Corporation own television stations that would likely see some benefit from the increased spending, the aim is to bring relief to local outlets belonging to smaller TV ownership groups.\nRadio and local newspapers have also been particularly hard hit by the staggering loss in advertising revenue since the shutdown began last month. Radio and broadcast TV stations are expected to see ad revenue declines in the range of 25% for the year, according to various analyst estimates.\nForty-five radio stations have signed off the air since March 11, the date the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic. Of those, 17, or 38%, specifically cited financial conditions related to the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for going silent.\nThe figure includes five radio stations in Maine that served their communities for 45 years.\nA growing list of radio and TV companies, large and small, have announced layoffs, furloughs, pay cuts, 2-week unpaid vacations and cuts in 401(k) contributions. Newspaper companies, including Los Angeles Times parent California Times, have announced pay cuts and furloughs as well after seeing print advertising revenue evaporate.\nAnalysts are saying the pullback in advertising is comparable to the Great Recession, which followed the collapse of the financial markets in 2008. Neither newspapers nor radio fully rebounded after the advertising losses the industries experienced in those years.\n\u201cThe current period, which will probably create a much steeper recession than 2000-01 or 2008-09, will have profound and lasting impacts (on) the current media ecosystem,\u201d media analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson LLC, wrote in a recent report.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a92020 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}, {"RECORDID": "20200724-162", "label": 1, "title": "Green Aluminum Maker Sees Opportunity in Green Hydrogen", "body": "(Bloomberg) -- With roughly half of the aluminum industry losing money, some producers may wish privately that they were making something else. According to analysts at UBS Group AG, that might actually be a good idea.\nPound for pound, aluminum is the most energy-intensive industrial metal. While most producers use fossil fuels to power the process of smelting, a handful of companies use hydropower instead to manufacture what they market as \u201cgreen\u201d aluminum. That group might better boost their environmental credentials and help cut excess industry capacity by shutting down aluminum smelters and switching into hydrogen production instead, UBS analyst Daniel Major said in an emailed note.\n\u201cAluminium smelting is the most energy-intensive large-scale process in the metals and mining sector,\u201d Major said. \u201cCould this green electricity be better used to produce hydrogen in the future?\u201d\nHe might be on to something. En+ Group International PJSC, one of the low-carbon producers, is committed to keep making green aluminum, but expanding power-generation capacity to serve growing hydrogen demand could also be an option, said Executive Chairman Greg Barker.\nAAPL\nSTZ\nTSLA\nAMZN\n\u201cThis is not an \u2018either/or\u2019 situation,\u201d Barker said in an emailed statement. The company\u2019s commitment to green aluminum \u201cshould not prevent us, if a successful economic case can be made, from further expanding our hydro-plant capacity in the future to cater for demand for hydrogen in other markets,\u201d he said.\nWhile hydropower gives so-called green aluminum producers a cost advantage, many are still struggling to turn a profit as the coronavirus batters prices and order books. Rio Tinto Group, one of the world\u2019s top suppliers, this month decided to close its New Zealand business, citing energy costs that made the smelter unprofitable. It\u2019s also threatening to close its plants in Iceland unless it can get a better power deal.\nMeanwhile, as the world looks to turn its back on fossil fuels, the idea that hydrogen could provide a viable alternative is quickly gaining traction. Hydrogen can be stored like fossil fuels, but burns to produce only water. In markets like Europe, investment in hydrogen-based power is set to surge as the bloc unleashes an unprecedented green stimulus package.\nGreen hydrogen, in which renewable energy is used to produce hydrogen by splitting water, is not a yet a commercially viable solution. However, Germany\u2019s stimulus plan announced last month envisions spending 9 billion euros ($10.5 billion) through 2040 to build 15 gigawatts of clean hydrogen capacity. Its inclusion was viewed as a nod to the more visionary aspiration of the budget, coming with the proclamation to make Germany the \u201cworld\u2019s supplier of the technology.\u201d\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}, {"RECORDID": "20200907-22009", "label": -1, "title": "State\u2019s new deaths down to 38, pass 12,000 including residents; cases up 2,564", "body": "Exactly six months after the first coronavirus deaths were announced, Florida\u2019s toll surpassed 12,000, including nonresidents, with the increase of 38 fatalities Sunday.\nAlso cases rose by 2,564, the sixth time since June they were under 3,000, and the first-time positivity rate was 5.06 in the state and 3.77 in Palm Bach County, the Florida Department of Health announced.\nPalm Beach County's death total rose by 4 to 1,166, second highest in the state behind Miami-Dade and ahead of Broward, after 2 deaths were reported Saturday.\nOn the Treasure Coast, one death was reported \u2013 St. Lucie rising to 245.

Ibarra, from CalMatters:\nThe state announced a new tiered system that gives testing priority to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms, and those linked to outbreaks.\nAs the nation grapples with growing demands for coronavirus testing, renewing shortages and delays in results, California is setting new guidelines for who gets tested first, state health officials announced Tuesday.\nDr. Mark Ghaly, health and human services secretary, said in a video conference that the state will prioritize vulnerable patients and those with symptoms. The state also will be asking medical providers to do more in-office testing, and for health insurance plans to pick up that cost.\nThe state\u2019s new guidance divides testing into four categories. The top priority will be patients hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms, as well as people linked to an outbreak. All other people with symptoms fall into \u201cTier 2,\u201d as do asymptomatic people who are considered high risk, such as health care workers and those who live or work in nursing homes, homeless shelters and prisons.\nEssential workers without symptoms fall under the third category. More widespread testing of the general population will occur once testing turnaround time is less than 48 hours, according to the new guidelines .\n\u201cWe all know that testing in California is a vital piece of our response, not only to focus on taking care of patients\u2026 but also to understand the patterns of transmission across the state,\u201d Ghaly said.\nIn the last several months, local health officials encouraged all people to get tested, even those without symptoms. Some counties promoted free, no appointment, drive-up testing for anyone. But as cases began surging last month and testing demands strained resources, Californians found themselves waiting longer for appointments , and sometimes even longer for results.\nAngel Ruiz, 31, of Van Nuys sought testing after attending a protest in late May. He first tried through the Los Angeles County website, but no luck. Then he tried a local CVS, and after several days of checking the pharmacy\u2019s website every morning for an open appointment slot, he was able to schedule a test. He got his negative results 11 days later.\nOther than a dry throat, he had no symptoms. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t know if I could go to the grocery store or if it was OK to come in contact with my family,\u201d Ruiz said. And the longer wait, the harder it becomes to stay isolated, he said.\nCalifornia has averaged 105,000 daily tests over a two-week period, Ghaly said. At the same time, the state is up against supply chain challenges and backlogs in commercial laboratories.\nCommercial lab giants, such as Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, have recently said that soaring demand is slowing their turnaround time for results.\n\u201cWe attribute this demand primarily to the rapid, continuing spread of COVID-19 infections across the nation but particularly in the South, Southwest and West regions of the country,\u201d Quest said in a statement on Monday .\nQuest performs up to 125,000 tests a day nationally, double what it was doing eight weeks ago, according to its website. Still its labs are outpaced by demand. As a result, the average turnaround time is seven or more days, a statement read. Priority patients, such as those in hospitals, can still get results in about a day.\nA Kaiser Permanente spokesperson said that it generally provides test results in two to three business days, but that fluctuates based on demand and capacity, and also whether the test is processed at their own labs or at a private commercial lab. Kaiser relies on commercial labs for about 10% of its tests in Northern California.\nAs part of its new testing strategy, the state is asking private providers\u2014 including doctors, pharmacists and nurse practitioners\u2014 as well as hospitals and clinics to do more of their own testing rather than refer patients to state-run testing sites. This will allow the state\u2019s sites that offer free testing to focus on populations that don\u2019t have as much access, Ghaly said.\nBy asking providers to perform more of their own testing, the state would also shift more of the testing costs to health plans. Ghaly said an average test costs $100.\nA spokesperson for the California Association of Health Plans said that while it is awaiting more details on the upcoming changes, health plans currently provide coverage for tests deemed medically necessary and ordered by a provider. According to federal guidance, health plans are not required to cover testing for employment purposes or for public health surveillance. Ghaly said the state is working on emergency regulations that would classify testing for essential health workers and for those with possible exposure as medically necessary.\nSome counties had recently made similar asks of their medical providers. Health officials in Santa Clara County recently ordered local hospitals and clinics to make testing more available. The county launched an online dashboard to show how its free testing sites were significantly outpacing local private hospitals and clinics in testing.\nSome providers, like those at health centers, have been trying to do more of their own testing, but struggle to get tests, said Carmela Castellano Garcia, the CEO of the California Primary Care Association, which represents the state\u2019s health centers.\nWhile some have adequate supplies, she said, health centers in areas like south central Los Angeles have reported having only 10 tests on hand at a time. \u201cThat means they\u2019re getting hundreds of calls from people wanting to be tested who they cannot accommodate,\u201d she said.\nAnd the turnaround time continues to be \u201calarming and unacceptable,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting seven to 10 days, and that makes the test pretty much useless,\u201d she said.\nCalMatters health care coverage is supported by a grant from the Blue Shield of California Foundation.\nWe want to hear from you\nWant to submit a guest commentary or reaction to an article we wrote?

He is leading a New York commission to reimagine sectors of the economy in light of the coronavirus pandemic. He joins us from Miami this morning. Good morning to you.\nFORMER GOOGLE CEO ERIC SCHMIDT: Good morning.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We just heard from one of the White House economic advisers that the worst is yet to come on the unemployment front. What jobs, in your view, will continue to exist?\nSCHMIDT: Well, a lot will but they'll operate in different ways. We're gonna have to reimagine how the workplace works. We're going to have to figure out how to get people into buildings that they're fearful of. My guess is we'll have more demand for office space, not less, because people will want social distancing. We're going to have to think about hub-and-spoke systems where local people don't travel so far because they don't want to be in public transit for so long. So we're gonna have to really rethink how businesses operate. They need their employees back.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: After 9/11 in- in Manhattan, you saw people establish homes outside the city. You saw businesses move and have backup facilities outside of major cities. Is there something that we know is in the works this time around?\nSCHMIDT: You can be sure that something like that will happen. If you think of it as an employer, you have a bunch of employees, some of whom are dying to get back to the office, and some people who are afraid that if they go to the office, they will die. They're very concerned about- they're immunocompromised or what have you. So they're going to have to come up with flexible arrangements. So imagine that there are three or four people. One will go to the office. One will stay home. Someone- some will go to some local or near their- near their town working environment. It will change the pattern. We've had this situation where people move to super cities in these incredibly concentrated ways. That will change in the next few years. You don't need to be in the super city in order to participate in the ex- excitement of these super cities. The commission, by the way, is intending to work not just on the city, but also suburban and all the rural folks. We have to be sensitive to the fact that everybody has problems. Everyone has concerns. And they're very different situations.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You know, corporations are being forced to try to do things in a different way right now. But many of them may use this as an excuse or as an accelerant to make some big strategic shifts. What does the economy look like on the other side of it? What does that mean?\nSCHMIDT: One way to think about this is that this one month, two months period has brought forth 10 years of forward change. So all of a sudden, the Internet is no longer optional. It's fundamental to doing business, to operate, to live our lives, all sorts of much higher expectations as a result. For example, we need much better broadband in the rural areas. Another example will be tele-health. 80 percent of the visits to doctors are right now in tele-health. People have been wanting this to happen for years. Now using remote monitoring, we can actually measure everybody and do it remotely. And then only if you have to, you go in to see the doctor. And by the way, that's more convenient for you as a- as a patient. There are all sorts of examples. Another thing that we'll have to do is we'll have to have all sorts of interesting sort of social monitoring of one kind or another to look for these hotspots. So systems will have to be developed to see, oh, my God, there's an outbreak over there. Let's get to it right now before the spread begins.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But one of the things that this crisis has also made obvious is not just income disparity, but- but access to Internet as you just said. If someone doesn't have access to broadband or they don't have the computer, how do you make up for that difference? Who pays for that?\nSCHMIDT: Well, we have to- we have to solve that problem. And when the government does another one of these huge stimulus bills, let's put some stimulus into broadband access, especially for rural areas. The cities are in pretty good shape. And then let's figure out a way for people who don't otherwise have access to computers through libraries or whatever, find a way for them to get access. Many people can access through their mobile phones. That's another solution. You can't participate in this new economy without access to the Internet. It's how you're going to learn. It's how you're going to deliver services. It's how you're going to market it. By the way, it's how you're going to sell. Right? So sales people won't be traveling as much. They're going to be doing it with the equivalent of Zoom and other services like that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not just- you're talking about federal funding to build out infrastructure like WiFi. But what we've learned, because of some of these backlogs in unemployment claims with the states, is that their basic infrastructure, their computers are so outmoded, they can't even process the amount of demand right now. Where does that come from? I mean, you're talking about re- not just rebuilding, but, you know, completely remaking how states function.\nSCHMIDT: What you're learning through this is that the government at the federal and state level have just terrible infrastructure in the software department. They're still using COBOL systems, which is a pro- system I programmed in 45 years ago. And those systems, you know, the programmers are no longer with us. So we've really got to upgrade these systems. And there are much better technologies that are much more secure, much quicker and so forth. You can see them in the- in the private sector. The public sector has lagged for whatever set of reasons. Because of this will accelerate all of that. If you look forward to it, what you'll do as a citizen is many of your services will be online, your health will be online, much of your education will be online. And then there'll be other systems like we need to figure out a way to de-densify public transportation. People will say it's better if you get on the subway now because it's less crowded, right? Because you don't want to be on a subway when it's full of everybody. These kinds of changes are easy for computer systems to do if they're in place.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning that the Trump administration is in talks with Intel and some other companies to move facilities back to the United States to have manufacturing be here. Do you see that change in the global supply chain happening?\nSCHMIDT: Well, we've built in the last 10 or 20 years this extraordinarily efficient global supply chain with many, many steps. We've now learned that it's not resilient. There has been for at least a decade a great concern about our over-reliance on Taiwan in particular for foreign chip manufacturing and there is an initiative within the government which is very important, that we get domestic supply of foundries, literally the places where chips are made. And companies like Intel and Samsung and TSMC. TSMC is the largest foundry. It's in Taiwan, at the seven nanometre level, trying to get them into our country. So we have better control. It's important from a standpoint of- of our own economics. It's also important for national security. We want to make sure that our critical infrastructure is owned and controlled by America, right? Never bet against America. We are the innovators in our world. We should be able to do this well.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll leave it on that note. Never bet against America. Thank you, Eric Schmidt.\nSCHMIDT: Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment."}, {"RECORDID": "20200630-55150", "label": -1, "title": "Georgia reports 100 new COVID-19 hospitalizations.

And the changes won\u2019t be limited to just contagious diseases. Various themes of sustainability will also weigh more on people\u2019s minds,\u201d he added, suggesting that societies may now become more tolerant of inefficiency in the economy if it results in more sustainability and safety.\nWhile Japan\u2019s drop in gross domestic product was slightly better than an expected 4.5% fall, helped by stronger-than-expected consumption and business spending before the pandemic escalated, analysts and policy makers agree that worse is in store in the current quarter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this quarter has gotten much worse,\u201d said economist Takeshi Minami at Norinchukin Research Institute, noting that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s April declaration of a state of emergency and tougher restrictions on activity came in early April. \u201cCompanies are struggling to secure funding and that suggests business investment will remain weak and many workers are concerned about their wages.\u201d\nDespite the rising sense of crisis, Japan so far appears to be doing less badly than other major economies.\nChina, where the virus first spread, shrank 9.8% last quarter on a non-annualized basis from the previous three months.

Canada is seen shedding more than 40% of GDP.\nFor Japan, analysts forecast a 21.5% contraction in the three months through June, a record for official data going back to 1955.\nThe crisis has put pressure on policy makers in Tokyo to step up stimulus measures that, at a record 117 trillion yen ($1.1 trillion), already total more than 20% of GDP by the broadest measure.\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, speaking Monday after the GDP report, said the government is aiming to pass a second extra budget swiftly to get more aid to businesses and households and warned of the risk of the economic pain deepening even more.\nBOJ\u2019s Lending Under Virus Program Triples After April Tweaks\nThe Bank of Japan last month lifted its ceiling on government bond purchases as the government ramps up spending. The BOJ is also expected to introduce another lending program for small companies at an emergency meeting that could come as early as this week.\nIn recent days, rates of new virus infections have fallen in Japan and the government last week lifted its state of emergency for 39 of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures, although Tokyo and other dense economic centers still remain under heavy restrictions.\nUntil stay-at-home requests are lifted, policy makers won\u2019t be able to spur growth no matter how much money is spent, according to economist Taro Saito at NLI Research Institute.\n\u201cFor now, they have to spend money to prevent job losses and bankruptcies,\u201d Saito said. \u201cWe\u2019re not at a stage where the Bank of Japan can boost demand with monetary easing, and the BOJ will focus on corporate financing for now.\u201d\nJapan\u2019s policy makers also have little control over the world\u2019s demand for the country\u2019s exports, a main driver of growth that could stay depressed for a long time. Even though key overseas markets are starting to reopen from lockdowns, progress will come in fits and starts, with the risk of new infection waves looming.\nMonday\u2019s report showed exports dropped almost 22% last quarter on an annualized basis, the biggest decline since the 2011 tsunami.

Governments that take human rights seriously are transparent and welcome conversations about addressing concerns and making improvements,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe spokesperson also addressed instances of police violence by saying, \"Every day in the United States, tens of thousands of police officers respect, protect, and uphold the civil rights of individuals and communities across the country while carrying out the difficult and dangerous work of keeping our communities safe.\"\n\"Throughout American history, our people have gathered peacefully to protest injustice and to demand accountability from our leaders and to effect change. While there are some who use the right to peaceful protest as a cover for destruction and criminal activity, many in the United States are peacefully exercising their right to peaceful protest to address the challenges our society faces,\" the spokesperson added.\nYet, American adversaries have seized on charges of U.S. hypocrisy, with China, Russia, Iran and North Korea hammering the U.S. as a chaotic state violating the human rights it calls on others to uphold around the world.\n\"This is the present reality of the crumbling U.S.,\" North Korean state media said Wednesday.\nChina has used the protests in the U.S. to call out American officials who condemn Beijing for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong, worsening already strained tensions over the spread of the coronavirus.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted , \"I can't breathe,\" a reference to Floyd's last words, when responding to a tweet from State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus calling for protecting freedoms in Hong Kong from the Chinese Communist Party.\n\"The [Chinese] media and the spokesperson seem to express sympathy to African Americans and denounce the police brutality - but it is not a new line,\" said Ho-Fung Hung, professor in political economy at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n\"It is just for propaganda value, definitely. Nobody believes that the Chinese government is genuinely sympathetic and concerned about human rights issues in the U.S,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, Russian and Chinese officials and state-backed media have jumped on coverage of U.S. protests, focusing on the violent images of looting as well as on systemic racism and police brutality, according to an analysis by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan, trans-Atlantic initiative tracking Russian and Chinese state-backed social media accounts.\nPompeo on Saturday addressed China's campaign against the U.S. in a statement calling it \"obscene propaganda\" and a \"callous exploitation of George Floyd's death.\" He also pointed to China's history suppressing opposition voices and its oppression against minority populations, like the Uyghur Muslims.\nBurns, who served as Under Secretary for Political Affairs during the Bush administration and is an unpaid foreign policy advisor for Joe Biden's presidential campaign, said American diplomats need clear guidance from the top of the agency.\n\"In the United States, in contrast, even amidst reckless rioting, we demonstrate our robust commitment to the rule of law, transparency, and unalienable human rights.\"ats need clear guidance from the top of the agency.\n\"I think this is a time when a leader of each of our cabinet agencies should be out speaking to their people, their men and women, saying, 'We believe people have a right to protest. It's a cherished right. It's freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. It's right there in the Constitution.

Among those saying this, 44% said they think they will be able to resume their regular routine by June 1, including 13% who said by May 1, while a combined 84% believe that will happen by the end of the summer.\nStill, concern over the pandemic continues on an upward trajectory, with 89% of Americans now saying they are concerned that they or someone they know will be infected with the virus, compared to 79% in a poll conducted from March 18-19 and 66% in a poll in the field from March 11-12 . The steady increase in anxiety includes nearly twice as many Americans who are now very concerned (now at 50%) in the new poll, compared to the earliest poll in March when it was only 26%.\nMORE: Coronavirus upends nation, as three in four Americans' lives changed by pandemic: POLL\nThe poll, conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News, using Ipsos\u2019 Knowledge Panel, asked Americans about President Donald Trump's handling of the global pandemic, their concerns over contracting the virus, how their lives have been upended by the crisis, and when they believe a sense of normalcy will return.\nBing COVID-19 tracker: Latest numbers by country and state\nAcross the three surveys, one thread remains: Democrats are more concerned about getting the coronavirus than Republicans, 97% to 80%, while independents fall in between, with 92%. The concern levels in the newest poll represent a high for all three ideological groups. Only 3% of Democrats and 8% of independents are not concerned, compared with 20% of Republicans.\nDifferences by party are even starker when looking at those expressing a high level of concern. Among Democrats, 61% say they are very concerned, followed by independents at 53% and Republicans at 33%.\nTrump's approval for his handling of the public health crisis is now falling closer to where it was three weeks ago, after a series of polls showed some Americans rallying behind the commander-in-chief - resulting in a slight bump in approval for his response.\n\nBut as the month of April begins, Trump's approval for his management of the coronavirus is now under-water, 47-52%. Approval is down from 55% in the poll released on March 20, and closer to where it was in the March 13 poll, when it was 43%.\nMORE: Two-thirds of Americans concerned about contracting coronavirus, as country grapples with growing crisis: POLL\nThe latest poll was conducted April 1-2, which comes after Trump and health officials with the coronavirus task force, which is charged with overseeing the federal government's response, warned the country to brace for a \"very painful\" few weeks ahead, after outlining dire projections on Tuesday that between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans will die of the novel coronavirus, even if social distancing measures are strictly followed.\n\nJust last week, the president offered a far more positive outlook, when he said he envisioned \"packed churches\" on Easter. But this week, in a sharp turn in tone, Trump said that the estimate of between 100,000 and 240,000 is a \"very low number\" in comparison to a 2.2 million projection if no action had been taken.\nABC News/Ipsos has polled three of the last four weeks, but during the one off-week last week, an ABC News/Washington Post poll was released.\nTrump's approval on coronavirus in this poll is close to his overall approval rating in last week's ABC News/Washington Post poll , when it was 48%.\nMORE: Coronavirus impacts: Disrupted lives, elevated stress, and soaring worry: Poll\nConsistent with this, in the new ABC News/Ipsos poll, perceptions of Trump among ideologues also appear back closer to where it's long been, with most reverting back to their partisan tribes. Only 9% of Democrats approve of the president's handling of coronavirus, which is less than a third of the 30% of Democrats who said the same in the poll two weeks ago. Meanwhile, 91% of Republicans approve now, which is on par with the March 20 poll.\nAnd, in terms of disapproval, the numbers show an exact mirror image, with 91% of Democrats disapproving, up from 69% two weeks ago, and 9% of Republicans saying the same, similar to the 8% in the last ABC News/Ipsos poll.\nAs most of society remains shuttered in order to stem the spread of the coronavirus, when respondents were asked in an open-ended question format what they miss doing the most since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the top response was freedom (20%), with friends (19%) and family (11%) coming in second and third. This was followed by dining out (10%), shopping (9%), working (7%) and church (6%). Fewer said entertainment (2%) and sports (1%).\nAmong the specific responses, one respondent missed, \"Going into Burger King having a whopper, drinking a pop, and using the WiFi,\" while another respondent, who invoked the tangible fear many Americans are now grappling with amid this new normal, said, \"Working ...

Chris Campbell, D-26th District, who was sitting nearby.\nDullum said\u00a0that she has spoke with Campbell about this issue.\nLast week, Campbell published a news release expressing her discontent with the election and state officials' refusal to adjust deadlines to account for mail service and other factors, saying people's votes were suppressed.\n\"An extension would've helped ensure that Hoosiers being adversely affected by curfews, travel restrictions and other unforeseen circumstances could still vote and make their voices heard,\" Campbell said. \"Our nation holds the 'one person, one vote' principle so dearly, and it's heartbreaking to see that damaged by rash and irresponsible decision-making.\"\nReach Ron Wilkins at 765-420-5231 or at rwilkins@jconline.com.

The letter asks that the last debate on Oct. 22 be moved up to the first week in September if the commission does not add a fourth debate.\nThe Trump campaign's argument is that the coronavirus has resulted in less exposure for the candidates and that several key states, like Florida and North Carolina, begin voting next month. Voters should be able to hear from the candidates before they cast their ballots, the Trump campaign argued.\nAxios first reported that Trump ally and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani made the request on Wednesday, with suggestions for moderators including Fox's Bret Baier and conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.\nThe bottom line is that the Trump campaign knows it is trailing Biden and feels pressure to draw him out, believing more exposure will be bad for the Democratic nominee. They're also working the refs in an effort to get favorable moderators. - Julia Manchester\nBIDEN'S RED STATE OFFENSIVE\nThe Biden campaign is going big on ad spending and committing to playing in traditional red states as it seeks to expand the map with 90 days to go before the election.\nBiden's campaign has laid down $280 million in paid television advertising and digital media reservations across 15 battlegrounds. That's the largest allocation in campaigns history.\nWhere Biden is spending\nWhy it matters:\nThe Biden campaign believes Trump's polling weakness gives them an expanded path to 270 electoral votes. In addition to the wider battlegrounds map, they intend to invest in a national ad campaign to take advantage.\nJust today, Monmouth University released a new survey of Iowa .\nTrump and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) have narrow leads of 3 points each in the Hawkeye State. Trump won by 9 points there in 2016.\nMany of the states Trump is defending are also Senate battlegrounds that could determine a majority in the upper chamber.\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, a top GOP super PAC, announced Wednesday a $21.3 million ad blitz to protect vulnerable Republicans, including Ernst:\nANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST: Progressive activist Cori Bush defeated Rep. Wm. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) in a closely watched primary on Tuesday, making him the latest Democratic incumbent to fall to a more liberal challenger this year. Clay, who has represented Missouri's 1st District for nearly 20 years, joins the likes of Reps. Eliiot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), both of whom lost primaries of their own in recent months to progressive-backed candidates.\nBush tried and failed to oust Clay in a 2018 primary. But a national outcry over racial injustice combined with the joint health and economic crises surrounding the coronavirus pandemic has served to bolster antiestablishment sentiment among many voters while elevating the voices of progressives who have called for sweeping social and economic reforms. That ultimately helped propel Bush across the finish line on Tuesday.\nMissouri's 1st District encompasses St. Louis and its immediate suburbs, and is considered a safe Democratic seat, all but assuring that Bush will represent its voters in Washington come 2021.\nThe Hill's Abigail Mihaly and Tal Axelrod have more on Bush's win here.\nSome other highlights from Tuesday: Missouri was only one of five states that held downballot primaries.

In terms of passengers, that represents a nearly 40 percent drop in what the port had been expecting for the upcoming season. In the last couple of weeks, the numbers have been changing almost daily as cruise companies rethink their readiness to sail amid a still raging pandemic.\nBefore the arrival of the novel coronavirus, there were some 137 scheduled cruise calls locally and an expected passenger count of 450,00 between September and May of next year \u2014 the highest in a decade after San Diego began rebuilding its badling slumping cruise industry post-recession.\nIn normal times, the arrival and departure of cruise ships from the piers on San Diego bay are a boon to local tourism, with passengers staying overnight in hotels and frequenting local restaurants, shops and attractions. With the cancellation of nearly 50 cruise calls, the estimated hit to San Diego's economy is $79 million, port officials say. That's on top of the more than $50 million economic blow the county suffered earlier this year when cruises were canceled toward the tail end of the 2019-20 cruise season that ended in May.\n\"The cruise lines would all still like to be cruising as soon as possible but that\u2019s still to be determined,\" said the port's Adam Deaton, who works directly with the cruise lines. \"I\u2019ve talked to our three main customers, and they don\u2019t want to rush it. They're hoping the COVID numbers will come down but with the current spike, it may be hard to talk about that now. We learn something new every week with this virus so it\u2019s hard to say whether it\u2019s too soon or not.\"\nOf the 49 canceled cruises, 12 are on Disney chips and 17 on Holland America vessels, which operate the largest number of sailings out of San Diego. Many of those cruises were destined for the Mexican Riviera, but there were also planned sailings to the Panama Canal and Hawaii.\nWhile the major trade group that represents oceangoing cruise lines recently decided to voluntarily suspend sailings in U.S. waters through Oct. 31 \u2014 a month later than the CDC no-sail order \u2014 Holland America announced this week it was canceling all cruises through Dec. 15.\n\u201cOur return to cruising will be determined by many factors, of course,\" said Holland America President Gus Antorcha in an emailed statement. \"As soon as society is ready and cruising resumes with all approvals, we anticipate to begin sailing as soon as possible in important key markets such as San Diego, where we historically have a strong presence for cruises to Mexico.\u201d\nPrincess Cruises also paused its schedule through Dec. 15, and Disney Cruise Line has canceled Mexico sailings on the Disney Wonder through Nov. 20.\nMeanwhile, the CDC is soliciting input from cruise lines on a host of public safety issues related to the resumption of cruising, from COVID testing of passengers and crew to instances where seaport closures may prevent the docking of cruise ships. The cruise lines themselves have so far been fairly silent on the specifics of how they will restart their operations and what capacity limits they might impose.\nIn it most recent order barring the resumption of ocean cruising through the end of September, the CDC noted that \"current scientific evidence suggests that cruise ships pose a greater risk of COVID-19 transmission than other settings.\" Among the likely contributing factors to the onboard spread of the disease, it said, are \"crew living and working in close quarters in a partially enclosed environment where social distancing may prove challenging even with a limited number of people onboard.\"\nLike the cruise lines, the Port of San Diego will also have to take a look at changing protocols at its terminals once cruising is allowed to resume. Deaton said such issues as social distancing, mask-wearing, plexiglass barriers and temperature checks are among the many precautions that will be evaluated going forward.\n\"We will work with our local partners, the CDC, county health,\" he said. We want everyone's buy-in so we end up with the best measures possible.\"\nIn the meantime, San Diego still has an occasional reminder of its shattered cruise ship business. Two Celebrity ships \u2014 the Millennium and the Eclipse \u2014 are docked in the outer anchorage area off the coast of Coronado, with a skeleton crew on board. By early June, the cruise line was able to return to their homes the hundreds of crew remembers still on board after the sudden mid-March shutdown of ocean cruising.\nEvery 15 to 20 days, the two ships will return to the B Street Pier for supplies and fuel, Deaton said.\n\"They're in a holding pattern until cruising starts up again,\" he said. \"They were thinking of going to Mexico but San Diego offered them the more efficient service they were looking for in terms of resupplying their vessels.\""}, {"RECORDID": "20200708-19978", "label": -1, "title": "'The main focus for everybody right now is survival': unemployed Latina millennial", "body": "Latina designer Diana Osario is stuck in her Bushwick, Brooklyn, apartment unable to travel selling her handmade dresses at festivals and apparel shows.\n\u201cThe main focus for everybody right now is survival \u2014 buying food and the essentials,\u201d Osario tells Yahoo Finance.\nThe 34-year old native of Colombia says she sold about 60 of her versatile dresses last year for $400 each \u2014 but demand came to a screeching halt due to the pandemic.

'You're juggling more than you normally would.'\nShe would normally go round several different groups working in 'situation rooms' where Curiosity's data and images are viewed.\n'I still do my normal routine, but virtually,' said Bridge.\n'It's classic, textbook NASA,' she said. 'We're presented with a problem and we figure out how to make things work. Mars isn't standing still for us; we're still exploring.'\nThe technology barrier was one of the bigger problems to overcome - the team usually use advanced graphics cards in high-performance computers when working at the NASA JPL facility in Southern California.\nPlanners rely on 3D images from Mars to calculate the path Curiosity to take and use special googles that rapidly shift between left and right eye views to show contours in the Martian landscape - but a home laptop can't run those googles.\nThe NASA switched to simple red-blue 3D glasses - the kind given away with old 3D movie DVDs and while they're not as immersive they work, said NASA.\nThe team ran through several tests and one full practice run before it was time to plan the \"Edinburgh\" drilling operation.\nThe operation involved sending a series of commands to Curiosity telling the rover to drill a rock sample from a location on the Red Planet named Edinburgh.\nThe sample was taken from sandstone on Mars - the first time it's been able to tackle a sandstone drilling site since they had to create a new drilling method in 2018."}, {"RECORDID": "20200810-22857", "label": -1, "title": "Reata Pharmaceuticals Tumbles on Possible FDA Approval Delay", "body": "Reata Pharmaceuticals  shares were tumbling Monday after the biotech beat Wall Street's second-quarter expectations but warned that a filing for one of its treatments could be delayed.\nShares of the Plano, Texas, company at last check were off 33% to $104.19.\nReata said that filing of a U.S. marketing application for omaveloxolone, a treatment for Friedreich's ataxia, would be delayed indefinitely if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires a second pivotal study.\nThat would be due to the limited availability of patients with the disorder, the small number of clinical trial investigators who can conduct the proper exams, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the company's ability to conduct neuroscience clinical trials.\nFriedreich's Ataxia is a rare genetic disease that causes difficulty walking, a loss of sensation in the arms and legs, and impaired speech.\n\"The FDA acknowledged the unmet need of patients with FA, reiterated its commitment to facilitate the development of omaveloxolone within the constraints of the regulatory standards, and emphasized its willingness to consider all available options to meet the regulatory standards,\" the company said.\nDuring a meeting with the FDA, Reata said it proposed a second study to provide additional evidence of effectiveness.\n\"If the FDA accepts this approach, we expect to complete the crossover study as early as the fourth quarter of this year,\" the company said. \"If the FDA rejects the proposal or if the data are not supportive, we will evaluate whether it is feasible to conduct a second pivotal study in FA patients as suggested by the FDA.\"\nRegardless of the interaction with the FDA, Reata said, \"we plan to pursue marketing approval outside of the United States.\"\nReata Pharmaceuticals reported a loss of $67.7 million, or $2.03 a share, compared with $34.4 million, or $1.14, in the year-earlier period.

I would have given my place to her.\"\nThere has been a major drop in the number of people behind bars in the U.S. Between March and June, more than 100,000 people were released from state and federal prisons, a decrease of 8%, according to a nationwide analysis by The Marshall Project and The Associated Press. The drops range from 2% in Virginia to 22% in Connecticut. By comparison, the state and federal prison population decreased by 2.2% in all of 2019, according to a report on prison populations by the Vera Institute of Justice.\nBut this year's decrease has not come because of efforts to release vulnerable prisoners for health reasons and to manage the spread of the virus raging in prisons, according to detailed data from eight states compiled by The Marshall Project and AP. Instead, head counts have dropped largely because prisons stopped accepting new prisoners from county jails to avoid importing the virus, court closures meant fewer people were receiving sentences and parole officers sent fewer people back inside for low-level violations, according to data and experts. So the number could rise again once those wheels begin moving despite the virus.\n\u2014-\nThis story is a collaboration between The Associated Press and The Marshall Project exploring the state of the prison system in the coronavirus pandemic. Damini Sharma and Weihua Li reported for The Marshall Project.\n\u2014-\nIn Virginia, about 250 prisoners were released as corrections officials scrambled to minimize the spread of the virus, accounting for less than half of the decrease in population in that state between March and June, the news organizations found.\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom last week ordered the release of up to 8,000 people by the end of August after a series of coronavirus outbreaks in the state's prisons. Between mid-March and mid-June, California's prison population dropped by more than 7,000, less than half of which can be attributed to an earlier decision by the state to let vulnerable prisoners out early.\nMore than 57,000 prisoners have tested positive for the coronavirus in facilities across the country since the outbreak began. Of those, at least 34,000 have recovered, and at least 651 have died, the data showed. Over 12,400 infections have been reported among staff, including 46 deaths.\nExperts and advocates said whether the public perceives a public safety threat from people who are released early because of COVID-19 is likely to affect the larger criminal justice reform movement, especially the push to decrease prison populations.\nWhile many people may be qualified for early releases, very few actually got out. In April, Pennsylvania launched a temporary reprieve program, allowing the state's corrections department to send people home under the condition that they return to finish their sentences once the pandemic passes. The governor's office predicted more than 1,500 would be eligible for release.\nSo far, the state's corrections department has recommended 1,200 people for reprieves, but the application process is slow and tedious, said Bret Bucklen, the department's research director. Each application needs approval from the governor, the secretary of corrections and the assistant district attorney who oversaw the initial conviction.\nNearly three months later, fewer than 160 people have been released through the reprieve program, while Pennsylvania's total prison population dropped by 2,800.\nAs in Pennsylvania, data from states such as North Carolina, Illinois and New Jersey shows coronavirus releases only account for less than one-third of the decrease in prison population, which suggests something else is driving the drop. According to Martin Horn, professor emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former corrections commissioner for New York City, the pandemic has slowed the entire criminal justice system, which means fewer people are going to prisons.\nBefore the pandemic, parolees were required to meet with their parole officers in person. For the last four months, those meetings have mostly been by phone, and people on parole are under less scrutiny and less likely to be returned to prison for violating the rules right now, Horn said.\nEven many who have been sentenced for crimes are not being transferred to state prisons. In North Carolina, the courts enacted a two-month moratorium on accepting newly sentenced individuals into prisons. By the time the moratorium was lifted in May, about 1,800 people were in county jails awaiting transfer to state prisons, said John Bull, a spokesman for North Carolina's Department of Public Safety.\nWhether prison populations rise once the pandemic eases will depend in part on how the public perceives people who are released early now, said Wanda Bertram, spokeswoman for the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on mass incarceration.\nFor example, if people leaving prison have little support and end up homeless, Bertram said she fears they may be more likely to get arrested for things like sleeping on the street, and the community may in turn associate early releases with more crime.\nGarland King, who will turn 78 in a few weeks, spent 12 years in a North Carolina prison for shooting and killing his son-in-law during an argument. Like many older prisoners, he has mounting medical issues, including asthma and arthritis.\nKing was scheduled to be released in June, but on April 17 he became one of almost 500 prisoners who were let go early for good behavior. Since his wife died two years ago, he needed to find housing and apply for social services. He fretted over everything so much that he barely ate in the days leading to his freedom and nearly had a medical crisis as a result. He eventually found housing through a community health program in Durham, North Carolina.\nNazgol Ghandnoosh, a senior research analyst at the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for sentencing reform, said that while the prison population decreases are a step in the right direction, she is disappointed by the numbers. Even if the COVID-19 release policies work as intended, they might not lower the prison population enough because states often exclude violent offenders from such releases, Ghandnoosh said.\n\"Even though we are sending too many people to prison and keeping them there too long, and even though research shows people who are older have the highest risk from COVID-19 and the lowest risk of recidivism, we are still not letting them out,\" Ghandnoosh said.\nThis report was written by Damini Sharma and Weihua Li of The Marshall Project and Denise Lavoie and Claudia Lauer of The Associated Press.\nREAD MORE: US prison population down 8% amid coronavirus outbreak\nCHECK OUT WPTZ: Get the latest Plattsburgh and Burlington news of the day.

A leader among utilitarian transportation hubs that have been transformed into upscale shopping destinations, Changi Airport in 2019 added Jewel, a futuristic play land with 1.5 million square feet of stores and attractions including a rainforest, hedge maze, and the world\u2019s highest indoor waterfall . And the government had planned this year to begin selecting contractors to work on a huge fifth terminal to boost annual capacity 55%, to 140 million passengers.\nAAPL\nSTZ\nTSLA\nAMZN\nThen came Covid-19. Traffic at the airport\u2014long a preferred hub for globe-girdling business travelers\u2014fell more than 99% in April, May, and June vs. a year earlier. Changi is hunkering down, mothballing two of its four terminals and delaying plans to build the additional one.\nAt airports the world over, the pandemic has wrecked a business model that relies on a steady influx of airlines and their free-spending passengers. So operators stuck with lifeless buildings are trying to dream up fresh ways to generate income. Changi is encouraging Singaporeans who aren\u2019t traveling to shop tax-free at the airport\u2019s struggling retailers. It\u2019s also selling three-month admission packages to Jewel\u2019s activity area. For other airports, new ways to make money include turning parking lots into drive-in movie theaters or unused land into renewable energy farms. \u201cWhat Covid-19 has taught airports is they need to diversify their revenue sources,\u201d says Max Hirsh, research fellow at the University of Hong Kong and managing director of Airport City Academy, which offers airport-related executive training courses. \u201cAirports are going to have to figure out different ways to make money.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a stark change from the previrus era, when airlines were desperate for more runways, gates, and terminals to sustain a global aviation boom. Now pandemic fears and travel bans have chilled interest in taking to the skies and brought much business and international travel\u2014the most lucrative kinds for airlines and airports alike\u2014 to a halt .\nFrance\u2019s Vinci, which operates London\u2019s Gatwick and 44 other airports in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the U.S., reported a 96% plunge in passenger traffic in the second quarter. Japan Airport Terminal Co., which runs Tokyo\u2019s Haneda, had an operating loss of about 17.5 billion yen ($165 million) in the three months ended in June, with revenue plunging 87%.\nThe International Air Transport Association expects $100 billion in aviation industry losses by next year, with a return to pre-pandemic traffic not happening until 2024. Even worse, international traffic may not recover before 2027, Philippe Pascal, executive director of finance, strategy, and administration for Aeroports de Paris, said in a July 28 call with analysts.\nStill, even though their customers are largely gone, facilities must stay open for business, says Mirjam Wiedemann, a lecturer and researcher in aviation at the University of South Australia. \u201cNo government can allow the hub to close,\u201d she says. \u201cA major airport closing, that\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d\nLarge operators are asking creditors for help. Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd. on July 9 said it secured a covenant waiver until 2021. Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide has also asked lenders for assistance. The top 10 airports in the U.S. face payments in interest and principal totaling almost $14 billion by 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nWhile they await a rebound, some airports have tried to put their real estate to use. Southern California\u2019s Ontario International operated a free drive-in movie theater in a parking lot in June and July. To generate long-term revenue, Edmonton International in Alberta last month announced plans to open a 627-acre, 120-megawatt solar farm. Munich Airport in June reached a deal with DHL Express Germany to build a \u20ac70 million ($82 million) cargo facility on land currently used for parking.\nTo save money, many are firing workers or closing facilities. Copenhagen Airports will cut 25% of its 2,600-person workforce and reduce costs by 325 million Danish kroner ($51 million), the operator said on Aug. 5. Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica Airports last month said it would temporarily close Aeroparque Airport, one of two airports serving Buenos Aires, for about four months to do renovation and expansion work.\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of government aid. In the U.S., the Cares Act included $10 billion that went mostly to regional and commercial airports. In negotiations for the next round of stimulus, Republicans have proposed another $10 billion, mostly for large hubs. Debt investors have so far been accommodating: Dallas Fort Worth International Airport sold $2 billion of bonds in July, though coronavirus cases in Texas were surging.\nSome Asian governments are betting the pandemic will be over by the time expansion projects are done. In Thailand, the first phase of a $9.4 billion project south of Bangkok is due to open in 2024. Hong Kong is spending $18 billion to expand its airport. China, South Korea, and Vietnam are continuing costly building projects, too.\nPlanners must look beyond Covid-19, Airport Authority Hong Kong Chairman Jack So said in June, when announcing a HK$35 billion ($4.5 billion) loan for its expansion project, known as the Three-runway system (3RS). \u201cThe pandemic crisis has not distracted us from our long-term vision of securing the airport\u2019s position as a leading international aviation hub, for which the development of the 3RS holds the key,\u201d he said.\nWhen passengers return, airports should reassess how they make money, says Greg Fordham, Melbourne-based managing director of Airbiz, a consulting firm that\u2019s worked on airport projects in Brussels, Dubai, Hong Kong, and Singapore. This could include arranging hotels for air crews and directly providing passengers with everything from fine dining to health treatments. The crisis \u201cis a great opportunity for airports to get involved in things that they haven\u2019t in the past,\u201d he says.\nBut for now, airports are concentrating on tweaking their operations to address the realities of pandemic-era travel. New Zealand\u2019s Auckland International said on Aug. 3 that it will split its international terminal into two zones\u2014one for passengers traveling to and from countries in New Zealand\u2019s safe-travel corridors, the other for travelers requiring isolation or quarantine. The airport has also suspended NZ$2 billion ($1.3 billion) of capital projects.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear what the recovery looks like,\u201d says Auckland airport Chief Executive Officer Adrian Littlewood. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect governments to come up with all the answers. The sector needs to get on its feet and propose answers to help figure out what living with this looks like.\u201d \u2014With Kyunghee Park\nRead next: Airbus and Boeing Will Keep Making Jets That Airlines Can\u2019t Buy\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}, {"RECORDID": "20200526-84566", "label": 0, "title": "Who Will Get the Coronavirus Vaccine First?", "body": "Many of us dream of a day when a vaccine will finally end the coronavirus pandemic.

Since 1964, the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has been charged with making such calls, USA Today reports .\nExperts agree that there will be a relatively limited amount of the vaccine available. As Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, tells USA Today:\n\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that the vaccine will come out more slowly than we like. We\u2019re not going to have 350 million doses delivered Day One.\u201d\nIn addition, the vaccine itself likely will have to be administered twice to anyone who is immunized, the Mayo Clinic reports .\nTwo shots are needed because people have no natural immunity to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The pair of doses would be administered three to four weeks apart, with immunity kicking in one to two weeks after the second vaccination.\nRelated: 17 Amazon Finds Under $20 That Will Organize Your Life\nWith two doses needed per person \u2014 and a limited supply available overall \u2014 some people are more likely than others to be vaccinated right away.

It's 11 million people.\"\nHyzler said a few specific conditions put Wuhan at especially high risk of a disease outbreak: the city's density, its role as a transportation hub, and the presence of live-animal markets there.\nAs of Thursday, the virus (officially known as 2019-nCoV) has killed 26 people and infected more than 870. It has spread to at least eight other countries: the US, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Scientists confirmed that it can pass from human to human, and early research indicates that the virus may have jumped from bats to snakes first .\n\"The people who are likely to die at first will be people who have other illnesses,\" Hyzler said. \"But as it spreads, it'll pick up more people like flu does.\"\nWuhan is sometimes known as \"China's Chicago\" because of its proximity to rivers and lakes, but it's about four times bigger. Its population exceeds that of New York City by about 2.6 million.\nIn terms of land area, the city is more than twice the size of Shanghai and eight times the size of Hong Kong. But people there live tightly clustered within the city limits. Wuhan is the most densely populated city in central China.\nCrowded conditions can increase the likelihood of people transmitting\u00a0infectious diseases , research from the University of Geneva has shown. That's because people in close proximity are more likely to touch, shake hands, or transmit the virus through the air by coughing or sneezing.\nHector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images\nOn top of that, Wuhan is a major Chinese transportation center. The city is one of China's most important railway hubs, with multiple stations connected to numerous rail lines, including high-speed rail lines that connect to Shanghai and Guangzhou \u2014 cities with populations of 24 million and 13 million people, respectively.\nThe city's Tianhe International Airport serves more than 20 million passengers annually. Wuhan is also an important port city on the Yangtze River, handling more than 1.5 million containers a year. This provides even more channels through which disease can spread.\nWuhan officials have effectively quarantined the city by shutting down transportation, including buses, ferries, and metros. Trains and airplanes coming in and out of the city were also halted.\nIts 11 million residents have been told not to leave , barring special circumstances.\nThe outbreak's timing is especially worrisome, since hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel to and within China for the Lunar New Year celebration, which begins Saturday and lasts until February 8.\n\"This couldn't have happened at a worse time for Wuhan,\" Hyzler said.\nThe Wuhan virus likely originated at a wet market , where locals and visitors shop for meat and produce among outdoor stalls. The markets put people in close contact with live animals, such as chickens, pigs, donkeys, sheep, reptiles, and fish.\nThese conditions can make it easy for a virus to jump from an animal to human.\nPhoto by Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than 75% of emerging diseases originate in animals. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in a wet market, as did the H7N9 and H5N9 bird flus.\nAuthorities in Wuhan banned the trade of live animals at wet markets on Wednesday.\n\"Ever since SARS, there have been calls for improving or closing down live animal markets in China and other countries, particularly in Asia,\" Eric Toner, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Business Insider. \"There's an awful lot we don't yet know, but I think it is fair to say that live-animal markets are a threat not just to the people who work in them, but to public health more generally.\"\nHyzler said close contact between people and live animals in Wuhan is a recipe for a pandemic (though the current outbreak is not considered a pandemic).\n\"Everyone in public health is waiting for another pandemic,\" Hyzler said. \"But in countries that aren't looking for it, you're not going to find it until it spreads.\"\nViruses in the coronavirus family also cause pneumonia, the common cold, and SARS, which affected about 8,000 people and killed 774 in China between 2002 and 2003.\nSymptoms of this new coronavirus include a fever, chills, headaches, and a sore throat.\nLauren DeCicca/Getty Images\n\"With SARS, people were only contagious when they were very, very sick, which is why it spread mostly in hospitals,\" Toner said. \"What we don't yet know is to what extent this disease can be transmitted by people who are only mildly ill.\"\nScientists are still learning about the virus' incubation period \u2014 the time that passes between when a patient gets infected and when they start displaying symptoms. During that period, people can be contagious without realizing it. They can also pass through airport screenings without triggering any red flags.\nAcademics from Imperial College London have estimated that the true number of infected people might be between 4,000 and 9,700.\n\"Being a coronavirus, it certainly has the potential to spread to countries all over the world,\" Hyzler said. \"This is going to spread to anywhere where there's travel out of Wuhan.\"\nRead more about the Wuhan coronavirus:\n2 dramatic charts show the rapid spread of the Wuhan coronavirus within and outside China\nThis map shows where China's mysterious, deadly Wuhan coronavirus has spread\nWhat you need to know about China's Wuhan coronavirus and how it could affect you\nEverything we know about the mysterious, deadly Wuhan virus sweeping across China\nA mysterious virus in China is a reminder that the world isn't ready for a pandemic.

Mike DeWine announced during Thursday\u2019s coronavirus briefing. Businesses will be required to follow a series of guidelines intended to limit the spread of COVID-19, such as limiting occupancy and mandating that employees wear face masks.\nGreater Cleveland personal service employees said Thursday they\u2019re thankful they can return to work, because many in the industry have been without a paycheck for nearly two months. But they also believe it was important to shut down so state officials could come up with a plan to keep everyone safe.\n\u201cI want to be able to work, but I want to be healthy even more,\u201d said Waverly Willis, founder of the two Urban Kutz Barbershop locations in Cleveland.\nSuzanne French, the owner of Style Associates Salon in North Olmsted, said businesses likely could have reopened a bit sooner, but the temporary shutdown was necessary to assuage safety concerns.\n\u201cI think it was necessary to close until we got a handle on this virus,\u201d French said. \u201cBefore we closed, we were all extremely stressed out, mostly with the unknowns.\u201d\nThe personal service industry guidelines largely mirror those for other Ohio businesses. Employees will be required to wear masks and keep their workspaces clean, and customers will be asked to wait outside until they can be seen.\nSome who work in the industry said they plan to go above and beyond the guidelines. French, for example, said she plans to require customers to wear masks, and even practiced cutting her husband\u2019s hair while he wore a mask.\nCorie Matyus, a nail tech at Alfredo\u2019s International in Beachwood, said she ordered a protective barrier that will sit between herself and her clients. The plexiglass shield is 30 inches tall and has a space at the bottom for clients to put their hands through.\n\u201cI think that if we now take a few extra steps to be proactive, it will only benefit us in the long run,\u201d Matyus said.\nRowena Yeager, who owns Studio Wish Salon in Twinsburg, has been meeting with her team via Zoom throughout the shutdown. She plans to keep her studio closed May 15 so employees can have a trial run, practicing on each other under the new guidelines. Studio Wish Salon also has custom face masks for employees.\nYeager\u2019s desire to go above and beyond the guidelines is rooted in personal experience. She shut her salon March 14, four days before the statewide order, after learning one of her clients tested positive for COVID-19. She ultimately tested negative herself, but the experience shook her.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to be back open, and I believe that what we need to do is be as safe as possible, and take a great deal of care for every single one of our employees and our guests,\" Yeager said.\nSome business owners still have some concerns about the new guidelines, describing them as vague. And French said she\u2019s worried that it could be difficult to obtain cleaning supplies to regularly sanitize her salon, since they\u2019re in short supply at stores. She\u2019s planning to buy a gallon of hand sanitizer from Western Reserve Distillery, which has been manufacturing it during the pandemic.\n\u201cWe have enough [cleaning supplies] to get started,\" French said. \"But do we have enough for as long as this will go on?\u201d\nAnother point of tension is the fact that many in the industry have been unable to obtain unemployment benefits since the shutdown began. Because many barbers, hairstylists and nail techs operate as independent contractors, they did not qualify for traditional unemployment benefits. After weeks of discussion about their status , the federal government finally announced last week that they can begin applying through the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.\n\u201cCosmetology and barber professionals have made significant sacrifices over the last two months to flatten the coronavirus (COVID-19) curve and help save lives across Ohio,\u201d Tony Fiore, the executive director of the Ohio Salon Association, said in a statement Thursday afternoon.\nWillis said he understands the anxiety many business owners and workers feel as their bills pile up.

Previous columns can be found here .\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - Scammers are continuing to take advantage of people during the coronavirus pandemic. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) recently put out a warning about a scam specifically targeting college students looking for a job as they head back to school.\nAs part of the scam, the BBB says a student will get an email to his or her school email address from what appears to be the school\u2019s job placement office, student services department or even a specific professor. The email encourages the student to apply for a job that sounds easy, has flexible hours and great pay. Often, the student will be hired without doing an interview.\nAccording to the BBB, once the student replies to the email to accept the job, a check is mailed to them with instructions to deposit it. The student is then told to buy gift cards, money orders, prepaid debit cards or other supplies needed for the new \u201cjob.\u201d The scammers will then tell the student to mail them what he or she bought. Sometimes, the student will be able to keep the remainder of the money as payment.\nHowever, there\u2019s no actual money that the student gets to keep because the check is fake. The scammer makes off with whatever was sent and also has the student\u2019s personal information to go along with it.\nThere are other common scams college students need to be aware of as well. The BBB says scammers often target students to apply for fake credit cards, phony apartments, and fraudulent scholarships and grants.\nIf you have children or grandchildren who are in college, make sure to tell them about these scams. Data from the Federal Trade Commission shows that younger people are more likely to lose money to fraud compared to older consumers. According to the BBB\u2019s most recent Scam Tracker Risk Report, 41.6% of students reported a loss when exposed to a scam, whereas only 28.3% of people who are not students lost money.\nWhile this scam specifically targets students, employment scams are very common. If a job offer, or really any type of offer, sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Never send gift cards, money orders, cash, checks, wire transfers or prepaid debit cards to someone you don\u2019t know or haven\u2019t met. Real employers will never ask you to pay them to get a job.\nThe BBB recommends people of all ages do their research before responding to a job offer they did not apply for. Look up reviews for that specific company, and verify that it has a professional website and legitimate contact information. A few other red flags to look out for include emails with typos or grammatical errors and being paid for work you haven\u2019t done yet.\nYou can report a scam to the BBB and see what scams have been flagged in your area by visiting: bbb.org/ScamTracker . Remember, you can also report scams, fraud and price gouging to the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s Office.

Scouting out new developments in the realm of food and drinks is central to what I do here at Esquire , and I was excited to see that there were plenty of new developments to check out in states like Indiana and Ohio and Missouri.\nI took a tour of Ryan Morgan\u2019s bakery , Sixteen Bricks, in Cincinnati, and I slid into a booth at Martha Hoover\u2019s candlelit chapel of cocktails and vintage albums, Bar One Fourteen, in Indianapolis. I knew that I would be a dolt to visit Cleveland without dropping into Larder, a deli and bakery that has become recently famous for its pickles and pastrami. I drove straight there from Columbus and parked a block away at lunchtime. St. Louis impressed me most of all. Within 24 hours I had three meals in St. Louis that rivaled anything I could find in New York or Los Angeles: lunch at Winslow\u2019s Table, dinner at Indo, and a solo brunch (I was the first person in line when the doors opened at 11 a.m.) at Balkan Treat Box, which serves Eastern European flatbreads good enough to make you stray from pizza.\nAs I binged my way through these states, it was not lost on me that all three of them\u2014Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri\u2014had gone for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Indiana and Missouri are core red states. Ohio (which pledged its electoral votes to Barack Obama in 2012) is a swing state so swingy that political observers have watched it for decades as if it were a weathervane. But I remember thinking that these Midwestern clusters of new bars and bakeries and restaurants\u2014vigorously independent businesses, deeply personal businesses, places that tell us stories about culture and immigration and resiliency and nature\u2014might represent a rising counterpoint, a kind of insurgency of delight, in regions of the United States that are still dominated by a monoculture of corporate chains.\nThese are bars and bakeries and restaurants that have, for lack of a better word, a funk to them. That regional funk is the secret ingredient that makes all that bread at Sixteen Bricks and Larder and Balkan Treat Box so delicious. I couldn\u2019t help but think that the food clusters in these cities echoed, in spirit, the regional music clusters that flooded college radio stations with new voices and ideas during the Reagan/Bush years of the 1980s and early 1990s. Minneapolis. Seattle. The South Bronx. Athens, Georgia. Dayton, Ohio. For a Gen Xer like me, acts like R.E.M., the Breeders, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, and Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five didn\u2019t just generate excellent music; they amplified and distributed ways of thinking that ran counter to the prevailing orthodoxy of political and economic power.\nI believe that fiercely independent restaurants do something similar, particularly in parts of the country where they act as an antidote to everything generic, mass-produced, and shorn of funk. By their very presence, restaurants such as Winslow\u2019s Table in St. Louis and Bluebeard in Indianapolis and Bouquet in Covington, Kentucky\u2014right over the bridge from Cincinnati\u2014tell us about the importance of supporting local farms, protecting the environment, and consuming more fruits and vegetables and sustainably raised meat and fish instead of the usual drive-thru burgers and factory-farmed dreck. These restaurants offer the green-state-ish idea that there\u2019s a different way to use the land, and they serve as a reminder that there is an infinitude of American stories to be told about community and fellowship.\nBut these are the restaurants that are most at risk of vanishing altogether as casualties of the coronavirus shutdown, and it probably shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that the Trump administration so far doesn\u2019t seem to care. (If regional food scenes, like regional music scenes, hint that alternative ways of thinking have gotten a foothold somewhere, why would an anti-environment, pro-pollution, anti-pluralism, pro-monoculture White House see any advantage in incentivizing that?) This week the James Beard Foundation and the Independent Restaurant Coalition released the results of a survey. The survey said that a vast majority of owners of independent restaurants\u2014almost 80 percent of them\u2014don\u2019t think the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) stand a chance of saving them.\nWe\u2019re talking about 500,000 or so restaurants that employ 11 million people, according to the foundation. Not coming back , or viewing a comeback as a long shot. Think about that.\nMeanwhile chefs from around the country\u2014indie chefs fighting for the idea that their creations deserve to stay alive\u2014expressed outrage that Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, a corporate chain, had secured $20 million in government aid.\n\u201cThis is absolute crap thanks for screwing the small business owner,\u201d chef Chris Cosentino said on Instagram.\nIndianapolis empire builder Martha Hoover posted a picture of an aristocrat (played by Roger Moore) smoking a cigar and chilling champagne in a bucket. \"Thank you to my restaurant colleagues for sharing your outrage,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRuth's Chris is sitting on 86 million dollars in the bank, yet they had the gall to request and now have received $20 million of the PPP fund\u2014a fund intended to help small businesses. Since when do publicly traded companies count as small business? And, how many truly small, truly independent restaurants got blocked from receiving any of the SBA bailout? ... I hate using my social media space contributing to negative anything right now, but I am motivated to take my outrage and turn it into a pitchfork for change.\"\nAnd San Francisco chef Mourad Lahlou posted this: \u201cThe real gems that make our neighborhoods so unique and special will all get fucked one way or another, sooner or later, if nothing changes RIGHT NOW \u2026 most neighborhoods will have the same shitty chain restaurants.\u201d He added: \u201coh wait\u2026 that sounds like Trumpville.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an intriguing point. This same week the White House put out a list of people handpicked to rescue American restaurants from the brink of doom. The list included executives from Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Kraft, McDonald\u2019s, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Papa John\u2019s, Jimmy John\u2019s, and Wendy\u2019s, and then it cleared a little extra space for four old white guys from the world of white tablecloths: Thomas Keller, Daniel Boulud, Wolfgang Puck, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who recently (without irony) compared himself to Christopher Columbus . (That\u2019s right: no David Chang, no Missy Robbins, no Martha Hoover, no Renee Erickson, no Kwame Onwuachi, no Edward Lee, no Michael Solomonov, no Nancy Silverton\u2026) The implication is obvious, and it spells out Republican ideology with an uncanny degree of clarity: You\u2019ve got your fancy foie gras restaurants for the 1%, and then you\u2019ve got an endless highway gridlocked with cheap garbage for the diabetic masses. Trumpville. Nothing in between.\nAnd what would be in between? As Food & Wine \u2019s Kat Kinsman tweeted about the president, \u201cDo you think that he has ever even once in his life eaten at a restaurant that is not either fancy white tablecloth or fast food? Anywhere at all in the middle? I am trying to picture it and cannot.\u201d Barack Obama may\u2019ve dined at Estela and Cosme, two spots that we at Esquire recently celebrated on a list of the most significant restaurants of the decade , but restaurants like Estela and Cosme, restaurants that (it could be argued) contribute to the cultural hum of a city as much as museums and concert halls do, appear to be invisible and indecipherable to the man whom Spy magazine once famously described as a \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian.\u201d\nThere has been a restaurant revolution afoot in the United States for decades now, a revolution that stretches all the way from Chez Panisse in Berkeley to The Grey in Savannah, Georgia, and which has hinged on breakthrough moments such as the publication of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s Kitchen Confidential in 2000 and the arrival of pioneers like Momofuku Noodle Bar in 2004 , and which has gradually spread outward to cities like Cleveland and St. Louis and Indianapolis and Cincinnati. It is a revolution that has transformed lives and neighborhoods. On two Esquire trips to Seattle, I have made a beeline for the Ravenna neighborhood to see what chef Edouardo Jordan has been up to: dinner at his JuneBaby on one trip, drinks at his Lucinda Grain Bar on another. On both visits, I wandered around the corner to check out the vintage vinyl on sale at M&L Records & Models, and inevitably I spent some money there. \u201cIt's the wine shop on the corner,\u201d Jordan recently told me in an interview. \u201cIt's the little breakfast place. It's the coffee shop. It's the old-school record store. It's all these little shops. It's the antique shop just one block away that all these people are finding out about because JuneBaby is in that neighborhood.\u201d\nGreat restaurants turn sleepy corners into hubs of activity. From city to city, the restaurant revolution has been a revolution in consciousness at the same time that it has been a revolution in foot traffic.\nAnd that revolution is officially over. It came to a stark and nauseating halt on Friday the 13 in March 2020. A virus put countless independent restaurants into a coma. It\u2019s agonizing to think that thousands of those restaurants, many of them on the brink of fostering new transformations in new places, might finally be killed off by the culture wars.\nBut to quote Kurt Vonnegut, a son of Indianapolis: \u201cSo it goes.\u201d\nYou Might Also Like\nHOW TO FIND THE PERFECT SUNGLASSES FOR YOUR FACE SHAPE\nIf You Don\u2019t Have a Denim Shirt Yet, What\u2019s Stopping You?\nWhy You'll Never Understand Mezcal Like You Understand Scotch"}, {"RECORDID": "20200307-39635", "label": -1, "title": "Son of Georgia medical chief contracts coronavirus | Reuters", "body": "By Reuters Staff\n1 Min Read\nTBILISI (Reuters) - A son of a top medical official in Georgia said on Saturday he had contracted the new coronavirus after being in contact with people who traveled to Italy.\nNikoloz Gamkrelidze, son of Amiran Gamkrelidze, head of the national center on disease control in the former Soviet Union republic, wrote on his Facebook page that the test for coronavirus came back positive.\nSeparately, Amiran Gamkrelidze said there were now 12 cases in the country - 10 linked to Italy, which has Europe\u2019s worst outbreak, with the other two linked to Iran, where more than 120 people have died.\nGeorgia, a South Caucasus country of 3.7 million, reported its first case of coronavirus in the end of February.\nReporting by Margarita Antidze; Writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Alison Williams\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200423-69189", "label": 0, "title": "Why the Queen and Princess Margaret were not evacuated during World War II", "body": "While the royal family has cancelled its public engagements in light of the coronavirus outbreak, it's business as usual for the Queen behind closed doors at the palace and she will still hold private audiences.\u00a0The pandemic could be one of mankind's biggest challenges since the world wars\u00a0and so, ahead of ITV's documentary Our Queen at War on Wednesday night, we\u00a0at HELLO! have taken a look back at what Her Majesty and her family did during that time.\nWWII broke out in September 1939 when the then Princess Elizabeth was just 13.

She declared: \"The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.\" Instead, the Princesses moved to Windsor Castle in 1940, where they spent most of the war years, entertaining staff by putting on pantomimes.\nAt the age of 14, Princess Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour to send her best wishes to children who had been evacuated from Britain to America, Canada and elsewhere. She said: \"We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well; for God will care for us and give us victory and peace. And when peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place.\"\nElizabeth and Margaret give their first broadcast\nThe King and Queen officially stayed at Buckingham Palace in London during the war but would spend nights with their children in Windsor. The couple narrowly avoided death when the palace was bombed in 1940 during the Blitz, after which the Queen said she felt she \"could look the East End in the face\". The King and Queen regularly visited badly damaged areas throughout the country after the air raids,\u00a0as well as hospitals and factories, and met troops.\nIn 1945, Princess Elizabeth became the first female member of the royal family to join the Armed Services as a full-time member, at the age of 19. During her time in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) she learnt to drive and to maintain vehicles.\nPrincess Elizabeth during her time in the ATS\nAt the end of the war on VE Day, Elizabeth and Margaret secretly mingled with the crowds on the streets of London to celebrate. In 1985, she gave a Radio 4 interview\u00a0in which she recalled memories of the day, saying: \"We cheered the King and Queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the streets.

The commission agents usually employ armies of labourers to unload, clean, weigh, pack and re-load millions of wheat sacks onto tractor trolleys that then ferry it to government and private warehouses.\nThis year, those bustling bourses have emptied, severing the food supply chain in the world\u2019s second-most populous country and slashing earnings for millions of migrant labourers who have had to sit out one of the most lucrative periods on the crop calendar when they normally would make up to half their annual income.\nTo accommodate the dearth of workers, marketing agents have been forced to stretch out their wheat procurement period from the usual 20 to 30 days to more than two and a half months.\nThat has cut the daily flow of farmers bringing crops to wholesale markets to about a tenth of normal, commission agents said, raising the risk of spoilage.\nIt also means delayed payments for growers, who say that will stop them from buying seeds and fertilizers for the next planting window that begins in June.\nRestrictions on movement have also delayed purchases by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) - India\u2019s state grain stockpiler and top buyer - and kept private traders away altogether, causing a purchasing bottleneck.\nThat is generating an ever-growing pile of unsold, poorly stored grain that will spoil quickly.\nAt 107.18 million tonnes, this year\u2019s Indian winter wheat crop is second only to China\u2019s projected 133.5 million-tonne wheat haul in 2019-2020, which is split between spring and winter wheat varieties and is gathered in two separate harvests.\nIndia\u2019s growers are ill-equipped to hold on to such volumes for long, as unlike their western peers most have no on-site storage facilities.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any means to store wheat. After a recent spell of rains and hails, I\u2019m worried about the quality of my crop,\u201d said Sukrampal, who has left a pile of wheat in the open air on his five-acre plot.\nNearly 85% of India\u2019s farmers own less than five acres of land, so even relatively small crop losses, or any delay in payments, can affect their livelihoods.\nIn addition, farmers say this year\u2019s staggered sales schedule to marketing agents means they will have difficulties repaying bank loans, which are also due at this time of year and tied to the annual preparations for summer sowing.\nLast month, in the Karnal district of Haryana, Reuters witnessed three wholesale markets which appeared almost deserted because of the absence of migrant workers, who come mainly from poverty-stricken states such as Bihar and Jharkhand in India\u2019s east. But the lockdown, which took effect from March 25, prevented them from making their annual trips to the Haryana-Punjab wheat belt for harvest.\nMigrant workers can earn about half their annual income of roughly 30,000 rupees ($394.72) during the wheat harvest, which normally tides them over until they return to the crop belts for the rice harvest in October, commission agents and market officials say.\nMissing out on that payday means rural spending will likely dip in the coming months.\n\u201cSince there\u2019s hardly any sale, I\u2019ve started working as a labourer to compensate for my losses,\u201d said Rakesh Kumar, a tea stall owner at a grains market.\nWith private traders largely absent from the market due to the lockdown, industry experts say they expect the FCI to buy a large proportion of the wheat crop, adding to India\u2019s already-bloated multi-billion dollar food subsidy spending.\nThe FCI is already saddled with massive crop mounds from last season and will not have enough room to store much new season wheat, according to industry experts. That raises the prospect of rotting crops even as thousands die from malnutrition-related illnesses each year in India.\nWheat stocks at FCI warehouses on April 1, when the new marketing year began, totalled 24.7 million tonnes, according to government data, more than three times the government-fixed target, and roughly a quarter of India\u2019s annual demand.\nThe FCI buys wheat from farmers at a guaranteed price to give them an assured return and meet any shortfall due to unfavourable weather conditions.\nIf the FCI ends up buying more than 37 to 40 million tonnes of wheat this year, its granaries will overflow by June, said Amit Takkar, chief of brokerage Conifer Commodities.\nThe government will struggle to export much of that, as the fixed domestic prices have pushed Indian wheat prices about $35 a tonne above the world market, according to industry experts.\nReporting by Mayank Bhardwaj in GHARAUNDA, India; Editing by Gavin Maguire and Bill Rigby\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200817-14873", "label": -1, "title": "San Francisco's mass exodus: Twice as many homes are for sale compared to last year as people look to leave the city", "body": "Nearly twice as many homes are for sale in San Francisco as residents continue to leave one of the most expensive cities in the country amid a pandemic-driven exodus.\nAccording to a Zillow report published last week, housing inventory is up 96% from this time last year, and listing prices have also dropped by 5%.

U.S. president Donald Trump has expressed unhappiness at shutdowns by U.S. states and says he wants \u201cpacked churches\u201d on Easter Sunday.\nMorrison hasn\u2019t downplayed the health impacts of the crisis but is seen to be prioritising the economy, while the biggest states, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, which have the most coronavirus cases, have pushed for faster containment measures and even talked of some form of lockdowns.\nSo as Morrison said schools would stay open, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews brought forward school holidays and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian asked parents to keep kids at home.\n\u201cAt a time of great public uncertainty, Mr Morrison has only succeeded in adding to the sense of dread,\u201d Professor Mark Kenny of the Australian Studies Institute at the Australian National University told Reuters.\nMorrison moved decisively in declaring a pandemic weeks before the World Health Organization and applied early travel bans on coronavirus hotspots like China, Iran and Italy, but the messaging since then has been \u201chot and cold, and some aspects of policy have undermined others\u201d, he said.\nThe different priorities are partly driven by how power is divided: states run schools and hospitals, while the national government, which will foot the bill for skyrocketing stimulus measures which already total 10 percent of national output, wants to avoid completely shutting down the economy.\n\u201cI am going to fight for every job I can,\u201d Morrison said after the national cabinet met on Friday.\nAustralia\u2019s tiers of government and size make it harder to match the much-cited success of Singapore in limiting both the transmission and death rates of coronavirus.\nVictorian Premier Andrews said on Friday that coronavirus transmission curves differed between states and that states would take action driven by their own needs for the next stage in the fight against the virus.\nAndrews and Berejiklian have indicated they are ready to move towards a more complete shutdown, while states such as Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia have closed their borders to non-residents.\nMorrison has warned Australians not to wish for a complete lockdown as such a drastic move could be in place for at least six months and would severely hurt livelihoods.\nA sign of the zeitgeist, retired cricket star Shane Warne drew praise for describing Morrison\u2019s late-night explanation of a selective shutdown of non-essential services including pubs, gyms and restaurants, and limiting funerals to 10 people but still allowing people to get a haircut as a \u201cshocker\u201d.\n\u201cListening to the PM like everyone here in Australia and what I understood was \u2018It\u2019s essential.

Even the federal government, which spends billions of dollars buying goods as diverse as meat, salad greens, medical equipment and jet fighters, has not increased the share of what it spends at home versus what it buys overseas.\nAs Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, put it, \u201cFor a president who almost every day on the campaign trail said, \u2018Buy American and Hire American,\u2019 he has actually done very little to move the ball forward on that.\u201d\nThe alliance is an advocacy group that broadly supports \u201cBuy American\u201d and has backed some of Trump\u2019s policies in that area.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pomp and circumstances, but when it comes to building out rules and making sure it comes together, it just isn\u2019t quite there yet,\u201d said Roy Houseman, legislative director of the United Steelworkers Union, which has been a staunch supporter of \u201cBuy American.\u201d\nOne reason for Trump\u2019s lack of progress has been his tendency to announce new initiatives, but then to move on to other subjects with little or no follow-through.\nShortly after taking office in 2017, for example, Trump seized on a Great Depression-era procurement law called Buy American, which he said would be used to strengthen rules requiring federal agencies to purchase domestically made goods whenever possible.\nHe issued the first of a series of executive orders that included requiring federal agencies to produce annual reports detailing their purchasing practices. Three years later, it appears that no such reports have been produced.\nAdministration officials did not respond to requests for the reports, and the White House provided just one set of data on \"Buy American\": direct federal procurement of foreign-made products amounted to $7.8 billion, or 3.6% of the total, in fiscal 2019.\nThat compared with $6 billion, or 3.5% of the total, in fiscal 2016, the last year of the Obama administration, said Peter Navarro , Trump\u2019s manufacturing and trade advisor.\nNor has the White House promulgated new rules limiting the current broad exceptions to Buy American policies, including waivers for dozens of trading nations.\n\"To me, the fact that past Trump 'Buy American' orders have included explicit language that guts their ostensible intent by prioritizing trade-pact bans on 'Buy American' underscores both that Trump has no interest in real change, but rather exploits 'Buy American' proclamations for political purposes,\" said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.\nNavarro blamed the lack of progress on \u201cbureaucratic inertia\u201d and on the fact that some products, such as electronic components, are not made in America, or at least not in sufficient quantity or quality to meet government needs.\nTrump's latest \"Buy American\" order, requiring critical drugs and medical supplies to be sourced domestically, was signed on Aug. 6 \u2014 several months after the pandemic exposed shortfalls of ventilators and other personal protective equipment. For years the U.S. has depended on imports of face masks and hospital gowns, among other gear, which are produced largely in China .\nNavarro, a former UC Irvine business professor and noted China hawk, said it took time to prepare the complicated directive, which asks a lot from domestic manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. trade representative.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden laid out a similar plan in July to secure domestic production of critical medicines, hospital equipment and protective equipment. He also has a plan to bring home jobs and manufacturing, including the investment of $400 billion in domestic procurement by the government and rewriting rules that allow many foreign companies to compete for U.S. contracts as though they were American firms.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d promise has also been hampered by opposition from inside his administration.\nInfighting over the program reflects the larger division inside the administration over basic strategy on trade and the economy.\nNavarro and other hard-liners have pushed for protectionist policies, including the trade war and tariffs directed at China, and a go-it-alone break with historical U.S. allies in Europe and Asia.\nMore orthodox GOP conservatives see that as a shotgun approach to the global economy that will hurt the United States in the long run and gain little in the short term.\nTrump himself has waffled, at times acting on protectionist instincts and at other times pulling back on policies that could dampen Wall Street.\nLarge business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have objected to expanding \u201cBuy American,\u201d arguing that it would burden American companies and ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers.\nThe oil and gas lobby pushed back against Trump\u2019s promise to impose \"Buy American\" on energy projects.\n\u201cI think it was back to the first week of the Trump administration when he specifically said, \u2018We\u2019re going to ensure that energy pipelines are made in America,\u201d the manufacturing alliance's Paul said.\n\u201cHe put together this presidential memo and that\u2019s literally the last we heard of it. It never materialized.\u201d\nPublic opinion polls show strong support for the idea of \u201cBuy American,\u201d and there is a solid bipartisan consensus in Congress for the approach, including among House Democrats.\nBut Trump\u2019s heavy-handed and often indiscriminate use of tariffs also has hurt many domestic manufacturers and the investment climate overall, constraining capital spending and industrial jobs.\nSome provisions in Trump\u2019s big corporate tax cuts in 2017 actually provided an incentive for American businesses to increase their offshore investments, researchers said.\nThe upshot is that U.S. manufacturing, ostensibly a key beneficiary of \u201cBuy American,\u201d has not done so well. Factory employment grew by about 500,000 in the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency but was flat in 2019 and by some measures fell into recession even before the pandemic.\nSeparate data from private sources suggest a similar trend. The number of offshore jobs that returned to the United States jumped to more than 84,100 in 2017, but last year fell back to 47,900 \u2013 less than the 54,900 in 2016, according to the Reshoring Initiative, a Chicago nonprofit firm that works with companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.\nFor government procurement officials, the price of competing foreign goods and services is crucial, said David Gallacher, a lawyer and government contracts expert at Sheppard Mullin's Washington office.\nUnder current rules, when non-Defense agencies evaluate contract bids by large competing firms, foreign-made products are treated as being 6% more expensive than their actual cost. Even so, that's often not enough to tip the balance toward U.S. suppliers.\nTrump\u2019s July 2019 executive order would raise that to 20%, giving a much bigger leg up to domestic producers. But that higher threshold hasn\u2019t taken effect because the White House has not yet issued proposed changes, which were due by January.\n\u201cAgencies have blown past deadline,\u201d said Gallacher, adding that the pandemic has further complicated the process and priorities for federal agencies.\nKim Glas, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations, said Buy American preferences for essential medical supplies is vitally important for the country and for her members.\nWhen the pandemic hit, it caused cancellations of roughly 90% of orders for the U.S. textile industry, she said, and the federal government\u2019s spending for face masks, surgical gowns and even things like cotton swabs for testing kits has provided a lifeline for some companies.\nBut what\u2019s needed, Glas said, is a well-formulated strategy that includes toughened Buy American rules for personal protective equipment and long-term contracts for domestic suppliers."}, {"RECORDID": "20200222-39640", "label": -1, "title": "Federal judge blocks effort to transfer coronavirus patients to California city", "body": "A federal court blocked efforts Friday night to transfer dozens of patients who tested positive for the coronavirus from Travis Air Force Base in Northern California to an empty building in Southern California.\nU.S. District Judge Josephine Staton granted a temporary restraining order after the city of Costa Mesa filed a request for an injunction earlier in the day.

When that lab is at capacity, those samples move even further, to Toronto, before being processed. While those labs have been \u201cvery responsive,\u201d capacity issues create further delays.

That prompted the province to change its COVID-19 testing criteria to prevent low-risk, asymptomatic people from accessing publicly-funded tests unnecessarily.\nIf approved, the lab could take more than a month to get up and running, according to Ahmed, who said some of the necessary machines would come from outside of Canada. Individuals with the right expertise to operate those machines would also need to be hired, though Ahmed said he was unsure how many jobs the lab would create.\nEarlier this month, Windsor Regional Hospital received provincial approval to purchase new technology capable of turning around tests for COVID-19, the seasonal flu, and other diseases more quickly than the two days it takes to receive results from the nearest lab, located in London.

She won her gubernatorial race in 2018 by 10 points, running on a healthcare and infrastructure platform, and delivered the Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union this year.\nShe declared a state of emergency on March 10, the same day the state held primary elections, telling NBC News that was when it became clear \"what we were in for.\" Within days, the 48-year-old governor has closed schools, barred large gatherings, expanded the state's unemployment benefits and put a moratorium on evictions.\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\"We've been on the front edge of each of the policy steps we've made, and I think they've all been right,\" Whitmer said. \"Now, if I can go back and advise myself at the beginning of March and what would I have done, I would have started buying every N95 mask I can get my hands on. I had no idea. I don't think anyone knew what we would be confronting.\"\n\n\n\nAs a result, Whitmer, like some of her colleagues, have taken to the air and pleaded for the federal government to provide their states with more personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, expanded testing capacity and ventilators from the strategic national stockpile.\nShe drew Trump's ire after interviews in which she suggested the federal government may be blocking Michigan's requests, leading some Republicans to push back. She later said the federal government was creating the conditions by which states were bidding against each other for the same equipment and driving up the costs.\n\"It's a source of frustration that there's not more of a national strategy on procurement of these critical pieces of equipment that everyone across our country is going to need,\" Whitmer told NBC News. \"And when we're bidding against one another and the price keeps going up, then we can't count on the national stockpile to meet our needs, it creates a very dangerous situation.\"\nSuch commentary led Trump to single her out, saying late last month he has a \"big problem\" with the \"young, a woman governor\" in Michigan, adding he cautioned Vice President Mike Pence not to call \"the woman in Michigan.\" Trump blasted her as \"Gretchen 'Half' Whitmer\" in a March 27 tweet in which he said she was \"way in over her\" head and \"doesn't have a clue.\"\nIn response, Whitmer tweeted she \"asked repeatedly and respectfully for help\" and that if Trump says he stands with Michigan, he should \"prove it.\"\n\n\n\nThe tension has eased in recent days . Trump said Sunday his administration is \"working very well, I think, with\" Whitmer as she publicly thanked the federal government for providing her state several hundred ventilators. Recent shipments from FEMA also brought in more than 1 million surgical masks and 2 million gloves, among other needed supplies .\nWhitmer said her administration is \"working really well with\" FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers and Pence, whom she says she's \"relatively frequently\" on the phone with and is \"kind and responsive.\" Trump gave her a call last week too, she said.\n\"I've tried to make sure that everyone understands, I'm not spoiling for a fight with anyone, I just need help,\" she said. \"And we're not one another's enemies.\"\nBoth Democratic and Republican leaders in the state have praised Whitmer for her ability to make snap decisions amid the crisis, even if they don't agree with each.\nMichigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, a Republican, told NBC News that \"while I haven't agreed with every order the governor's made over the past several weeks, I think she's been decisive.\"\nSlideshow by photo services\nPointing to Whitmer's back-and-forth with Trump, Nessel said the governor \"has a wicked sense of humor\" and \"privately swears like a sailor.\"\n\"I can't imagine how hard it must be for her to restrain herself when Trump makes some of these asinine statements and not to just retort back with the most smart-ass comment you can imagine,\" Nessel said.\nWhitmer herself seemed to embrace some of the back-and-forth with the president, donning a shirt emblazoned with \"That Woman From Michigan\" during a recent interview with \"The Daily Show.\" She said she thought wearing the shirt would \"make a little light of it\" and \"show I don't take any of this personally.\"\nBuzz about Whitmer as a possible VP pick grew when she made an appearance Monday on Biden's new podcast \"Here's the Deal.\" Biden commended her for how \"impressive and important\" she's been \"in the absence of presidential leadership.\"\nShe's sought to tamp down on the VP talk, but her Michigan allies think she'd be a great choice.\n\"I think in any other times it'd be incredibly flattering,\" Whitmer told NBC News. And I'm not (saying) that it's not, but I am so consumed by trying to fight COVID-19 and build all the alliances that I can, that I have not devoted a whole lot of energy on that realm.\"\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\nChristine Grieg, the Michigan House Democratic leader, said Whitmer has proven she's up for the job and that Americans want to see someone on the ticket this fall who's \"competently\" dealt with the crisis.\n\"In my eyes, that's in contrast to what we've seen coming, frankly, from the president,\" Grieg said. \"I think that comparison will be made at the national stage too when we get further into the election year.\"\nNessel said Whitmer would be an \"amazing\" vice president and that she's been effective at getting Trump to pay attention to what her state needs.\n\n\n\n\"I think she's at least calculating enough to know and to understand that Trump needs to win Michigan if he is going to be successful in his re-election bid,\" Nessel said.\nMichigan was one of the three Rust Belt states that helped put his 2016 candidacy over the top \u2014 a place Trump won by fewer than 11,000 votes. Meanwhile, in her 2018 gubernatorial bid, Whitmer won just 13,000 fewer votes than Trump \u2014 a very strong showing for an off-year election.\nLate last month, a Marketing Resource Group poll of Michigan found that Trump's approval was split at 45 percent approving and 45 percent disapproving. Meanwhile, Whitmer's job approval has surged more than 15 points to 60 percent , with just 22 percent disapproving.\n\"I hope Trump understands how important it is that he provide Michigan with everything we need to combat the virus in our state,\" Nessel said. \"And I know that's her sole mission and goal.\""}, {"RECORDID": "20200827-75543", "label": 0, "title": "At Republican convention, rising stars show unity around Trump but division over party's future", "body": "Amid vast uncertainty about the Republican Party\u2019s future, several of its rising stars spoke at the convention this week with a dual purpose: falling in line behind President Trump while finding a lane for themselves.\nThe up-and-comers, many eyeing a run for president in 2024, were unanimous in singing Trump\u2019s praises, but they pointed to very different paths into the party\u2019s future.\nTheir varied approaches illustrate the larger problem facing Republicans thinking about their party\u2019s post-Trump era: Amid an economic downturn, a pandemic and uncertainty about whether Trump can win in the fall, it's anyone's guess what the party may stand for after Trump leaves the White House.\nDonald Trump Jr. offered a high-volume re-commitment to his father\u2019s culture wars as he warned that \"anarchists have been flooding our streets.\"\nA more inclusive, low-key message came from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the \u201cproud daughter of Indian immigrants,\u201d who came closer than any other speaker to saying \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d\nA third approach, somewhere between those two poles, came from Vice President Mike Pence, who has developed his own brand: a calmer, blander voice of Trumpism.\n\"The choice in this election has never been clearer,\" Pence said in his acceptance speech in Baltimore on Wednesday night. \"It's not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The choice in this election is whether America remains America.\"\nIn a traditional political climate, Pence would have a leg up in the coming struggle for leadership of the GOP. Nine of his 14 predecessors as vice president since World War II eventually won their party\u2019s presidential nomination. But like all things in the Trump era, the traditional order is likely to be disrupted. Even if Trump wins in 2020, Pence is no shoo-in to be his successor.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake,\u201d said Henry Barbour, a Mississippi member of the Republican National Committee. \u201c2024, regardless of what happens in November, is going to be a wide-open contest.\u201d\nThe potential contestants are many, and, like the party's voters, they fall into categories that range from Trump die-hards to \u201cNever Trumpers.\u201d In between sits a swath of Republicans who embrace elements of Trumpism but without the president\u2019s trademark bombast.\nMany potential 2024 contenders were not featured on the convention stage. Among the excluded were those who keep their distance from Trump, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a conservative who has complained about the run-up of federal spending under Trump, and Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, one of the few GOP elected officials who has openly criticized Trump.\nThe ones who secured speaking slots were those with a relationship to Trump, including his son, two Cabinet members and a golfing buddy. They offered a diverse menu of political styles and outlook, a sliding scale of Trumpiness.\nAt the top of the scale is Trump\u2019s oldest son. Mirroring his father's pugnacious style, Donald Trump Jr. conferred derisive nicknames on Joe Biden \u2014 \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d and the \u201cLoch Ness Monster of the Swamp\u201d \u2014 and portrayed recent street protests against racism as a sign of cultural collapse.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like this election is shaping up to be church, work and school versus rioting, looting and vandalism,\u201d Trump Jr. said.\nAlso closely tied to Trumpism: Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo. In Trump\u2019s tradition-flouting spirit, Pompeo spoke to the convention via video from Jerusalem, where he was traveling on official business. Critics cited several ethics rules he may have violated.\nThe venue allowed Pompeo to spotlight Trump\u2019s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv \u2014 a top priority for evangelical voters who are a key part of the GOP base.\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a 2016 presidential candidate who may run again, disagrees with the president on many issues and as a 2016 presidential rival called Trump a \u201cdelusional narcissist.\u201d But he now golfs frequently with the president, and in his convention speech he called Trump \u201ca normal guy\u201d who \u201cgets things done.\u201d\nHe put differences aside to spotlight Trump\u2019s efforts to reduce U.S. military involvement in world affairs \u2014 a central goal of his own failed presidential bid.\n\u201cIf you hate war like I hate war,\u201d Paul said, \u201c\u2026 you need to support President Trump for another term!\u201d\nHaley\u2019s convention speech pointed to a governing philosophy far more optimistic than the dark, divisive rhetoric that has dominated the convention and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. A rare woman of color in the upper ranks of the GOP, Haley tried to stand as a character witness against claims that the party is racist and misogynistic.\nAfter some ritual Biden-bashing, Haley settled into an account of her Indian heritage.\n\u201cMy father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a brown girl in a black and white world.\u201d\nHaley even evoked \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d but with a law-and-order twist: \u201cThe Black cops who\u2019ve been shot in the line of duty \u2014 they matter,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Black small-business owners who\u2019ve watched their life\u2019s work go up in flames \u2014 they matter.\u201d\nIf any rising star had a breakthrough moment at the convention, it was Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who like Haley offered a more inclusive and aspirational message. The only Black Republican in the Senate, Scott told of his grandfather\u2019s work picking cotton as a child.\n\u201cOur family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\u201d he said.\nHe\u2019s not been widely viewed as a presidential contender, but that could change.\n\u201cTim Scott vaulted himself into the top tier for 2024 with his speech,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a GOP strategist.\nBut the one with the most straightforward \u2014 and yet perhaps the most fraught \u2014 path was Pence: His future is so inextricably bound to Trump\u2019s that he can do nothing but put his all into Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an adherent of the view that the best way to get a better job is to do the best at the one you have,\u201d said John Hammond, an Indiana member of the Republican National Committee. \u201cHis job now is to be a loyal supporter for this president and his agenda.\u201d\nPence is working to avoid the fate of another Indiana politician: Dan Quayle, President George H.W. Bush\u2019s vice president, who all but vanished from the political scene after the Bush-Quayle ticket lost its bid for a second term in 1992.\nPence hopes to follow a path more like Bush\u2019s own in 1988, when he won the GOP nomination and the presidency after serving two terms as a loyal vice president to Ronald Reagan.\nIn his acceptance speech, Pence framed the choice for voters around the ailing economy: \"On November 3rd, ask yourself: Who do you trust to rebuild this economy?\" he asked.\nBut Pence may struggle in 2024 if Republicans are looking for a Trump replica, not a Trump loyalist.\n\u201cMaybe Pence doesn\u2019t have the normal advantage the vice president would have,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a former Quayle chief of staff who is now a vocal Trump critic.\n\u201cEven if Trump wins, there are so many other people who can be Trumpier successors.\u201d"}, {"RECORDID": "20200616-21877", "label": 1, "title": "Oil prices rise 3% on signs of U.S. economic recovery | Reuters", "body": "By Devika  Krishna Kumar\n3 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose 3% in volatile trade on Tuesday as Wall Street surged and the International Energy Agency (IEA) increased its oil demand forecast for 2020, but gains were capped by worries about a second wave of coronavirus cases.\nBrent crude futures LCOc1 ended the session up $1.24, or 3.1%, at $40.96 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) CLc1 rose $1.26, or 3.4% to settle at $38.38 a barrel.\nOil gave up some gains in post-settlement trade after U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.9 million barrels last week, according to industry group the American Petroleum Institute, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for 152,000-barrel draw.

Here\u2019s one laid out by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO Frank Del Rio on Thursday: 18 months without any revenue.\nDel Rio offered that worst case scenario during his company\u2019s first quarter earnings call, giving insight into the extent of the damage the two-month global pause in cruising has had on the industry.\nTotal revenue fell 11 percent to $1.25 billion in the first quarter, which ended on Mar. 31, roughly two weeks after cruising was halted. The cruise line posted a net loss of $1.88 billion \u2014 due to a combination of factors including cancelled voyages, fuel loss, and a $1.6 billion non-cash impairment \u2014 which translates to a loss of $8.80 per share. In the same quarter last year, the company saw a profit of $118.2 million, or $0.54 per share.\nSince the company\u2019s last earnings call, Del Rio said, \u201cwe have laid up our entire fleet, repatriated over half of our 28,000 crew members, significantly pared back operating and capital expenditures, improved our debt maturity profile and successfully completed a historic simultaneously executed quad tranche capital raise of $2.4 billion. These actions will enable us to weather the unlikely scenario of over 18 months in a zero revenue environment and still have enough liquidity to relaunch operations when conditions allow.\u201d\nThe company did not provide second quarter or full year guidance, due to the unprecedented amount of uncertainty about when they will be able to sail again, what demand might look like, and what protocols they may have to put into place to meet health and safety protocols. The Centers for Disease Control\u2019s current no sail order is set to expire in late July, though it\u2019s possible it might be extended again.\nOn a possible timeline for resuming operations and returning to profitability, Del Rio did not mince words. \u201c2020 is a wasted year. At a minimum, the industry is going to go the entire Q2 without a penny of revenue, impossible to overcome.\u201d\nDel Rio posited that a possible return to service might happen in stages, with a handful of the company\u2019s 28 vessels coming online over a period of five to six months, before the full fleet resumes sometime in 2021. Marketing operations would, at some point, ramp up alongside that.\n\u201cThe things we normally talk about are out the door,\u201d Del Rio went on. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about just \u2014 it\u2019s almost like relaunching a company from scratch when you have the entire fleet shut down, and you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to be able to start again because it\u2019s not up to you. It\u2019s up to public health officials and governments around the world. It\u2019s very difficult to predict with certainty revenue and (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) EBITDA.\u201d\nA prominent topic on the call was what protocols will be put into place to make sure cruising is safe and consumers are confident to book a cruise when they can. Del Rio said the cruise line was consulting with experts and working on introducing a series of protocols that will help convince the CDC it would be appropriate to lift its no sail order. Once it has that, the cruise line will begin communicating those actions to the cruising public. However, he said the process will take time.\n\u201cThis is not an exercise of optics. This is not an exercise of, let\u2019s get away with the minimum required,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cI want to do everything humanly possible within the bounds of what technology offers us today to be able to look my own family in the eye and say, \u2018You are safe to go onboard our cruise ship.\u2019 And until we do that, respective of what the CDC or anybody else might say, we\u2019re not going to operate.\u201d\nThe company is still accepting bookings for 2020, 2021, and 2022, but said it is accepting less bookings than this time last year. It said that slightly more than half of the guests who had their voyages cancelled have requested refunds, rather than the other option of a 125 percent cruise credit that can be used through 2022.\n\u201cI recognize that this is going to be a recovery effort that\u2019s going to take multiple quarters, perhaps multiple years to get back to good old days of 2019,\u201d Del Rio said.\nSubscribe to Skift newsletters for essential news about the business of travel."}, {"RECORDID": "20200507-32562", "label": -1, "title": "Boris Johnson Has Zero Margin for Error", "body": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The instruction given by Boris Johnson to the British people on March 23 was dead simple: \u201cYou must stay at home.\u201d The pithiness and urgency of that message, the alarming rise in deaths, and the U.K. prime minister\u2019s subsequent hospitalization with Covid-19 all reinforced the instruction. People got it.\nAAPL\nSTZ\nTSLA\nAMZN\nSome say it was too successful. Many Britons don\u2019t seem to want to come out of lockdown now. The all-important R-number \u2014\u00a0the average number of people infected by one person\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is now said to be below one. But how to keep it there while getting people back to work?\nJohnson\u2019s task on Sunday, when he\u2019ll set out the circumstances under which people can resume parts of their old lives, will require far more granular and sophisticated communication. There\u2019s only one way into lockdown, but multiple routes out.\nThe government\u2019s grave errors in the early stages of the pandemic make the reopening perilous politically. Having been slow to increase testing, Britain improved during April, but it\u2019s a long way from the mass examinations needed to provide confidence in a steady return to normality. The other component of a successful unlocking strategy \u2014\u00a0contact tracing \u2014\u00a0is being trialed on the Isle of Wight . But the U.K.\u2019s home-grown solution may prove inferior to the Google and Apple Inc. technology that countries like Germany and Switzerland opted for.\nBritain\u2019s abject record in fighting the virus leaves Johnson very little margin for error. The U.K. death toll has surpassed that of Italy, making it the worst-hit country in Europe, and second globally to the U.S. The official number\u00a0of more than\u00a030,000 fatalities is probably far smaller than the real figure. Data from the Office for National Statistics show\u00a0that over 42,000 more people have died than is normal since mid-March.\nAs Keir Starmer, the opposition Labour\u00a0Party leader, asked Johnson on Wednesday: \u201cHow on earth did it come to this?\u201d The government has two answers to that question, neither very satisfying.\nThe first is that it\u2019s too early to make conclusive judgments about death tolls. The relative numbers between nations may look different some months down the road when a full accounting is made. Even so, there\u2019s no chance that Britain\u2019s death rate will not look horrible when compared with Germany, South Korea and many other countries. While there may be an argument for taking international comparisons with a grain of salt, U.K. ministers have been using this information at every news conference for weeks.\nThe government\u2019s second answer to Starmer\u2019s question \u2014\u00a0that it has been \u201cguided by the science\u201d \u2014\u00a0looks even more dubious, given all of the confusion and mystery around this guidance. On Monday it bowed to pressure to release the names of members of the influential Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), after growing criticism about the dangers of shrouding the advice in secrecy.\nOn Tuesday, one of the most prominent SAGE members, Imperial College professor Neil Ferguson, resigned after the Daily Telegraph reported that he had violated social distancing rules to meet his married lover. It was Ferguson\u2019s controversial models that most influenced the government\u2019s lockdown policy. He apologized and said he\u2019d figured that since he\u2019d had Covid-19 and completed his period of self-isolation he was immune. Scientists aren\u2019t entirely sure what immunity the virus confers, so that\u2019s an odd statement from one of the government\u2019s chief advisers on the pandemic.\nThe timing of the Ferguson disclosure is significant too. A backlash against Johnson\u2019s lockdown \u2014\u00a0and the evidence on which it was based \u2014\u00a0has been building, especially among members of Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party. Steve Baker , an arch-Brexiter, says the restrictions are \u201cabsurd, dystopian and tyrannical.\u201d Jonathan Sumption , a former U.K. Supreme Court judge, wrote a column calling the lockdown \u201cwithout doubt the greatest interference with personal liberty in our history.\u201d\u00a0That was applauded by Tesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk .\nFerguson\u2019s indiscretion is a gift to this campaign against restrictions. It doesn\u2019t help confidence in the government\u2019s policies if the man known as \u201cProfessor Lockdown\u201d wasn\u2019t following the advice he repeatedly trumpeted on national media. His resignation provided an opportunity to question not just his judgment but his scientific models .\nJohnson will want to\u00a0respond in some way to this pressure to restore economic activity from the right of his party, the same people who delivered him power.\u00a0But between Sweden\u2019s light-touch approach and South Korea\u2019s leave-nothing-to-chance policies, Johnson is leaning toward the latter. This seems to be born of the conviction that voters won\u2019t tolerate the trade-off of losing lots of lives in exchange for getting back to work. Johnson\u2019s own experience of Covid-19 will no doubt shape his thinking. There\u2019s also a more pragmatic calculation that any new infection spike could deal the economy an even bigger setback.\nPolls seem to bear out the prime minister\u2019s caution. An Opinium poll for the Observer published last weekend showed that only 17% of people felt conditions were right for reopening schools. Only 9% thought it would be right to consider reopening pubs and even fewer said a return of sporting events or concerts should be allowed.\nYet support for the lockdown has been accompanied by a growing sense of public unhappiness with Johnson and his colleagues. The percentage of people who approve of the government\u2019s management of the crisis has fallen to 47% from 61% three weeks ago. There will be little tolerance for more mistakes.\nHaving been tentative going into the lockdown, at such great cost, Johnson cannot now be anything but cautious in coming out of it. He\u2019ll just have to find a way to make the new policy sound as straightforward and convincing as the one it replaces. He can\u2019t afford to get the reopening wrong too.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTherese Raphael is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion.

Yet pushback within his government and reports of divided opinions in the Trump administration have created obstacles.\nForeign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi estimated in an interview Wednesday with Army Radio that there wouldn\u2019t be any movement on the target start date. The prime minister, who discussed annexation this week with U.S. officials in Jerusalem, hasn\u2019t signaled how much land he seeks to claim.\nNetanyahu Keeps Annexation Details Close With Key Date Near\nA unilateral Israeli step would throw over decades of negotiations that sought to resolve the fate of the West Bank in a peace treaty, and risk renewed conflict with the Palestinians, who say it would destroy their dream of a homeland. A new report on annexation from the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s negotiations department carries the subtitle: \u201cIsrael\u2019s Denial of Palestine\u2019s Right to Exist.\u201d\nMovement on annexation could also bring diplomatic and economic penalties from European and Arab powers. The Trump administration, by contrast, supports annexation within the context of its Middle East peace plan, emboldening Netanyahu.\nThe Palestinians and most countries contend that annexation would violate an international treaty that bars occupying states from extending sovereignty over vanquished areas. Israel disputes this on the ground that it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war from Jordan and not from a sovereign Palestinian state.\nIn the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, tens of thousands turned out to protest the annexation plan, waving Palestinian flags and chanting slogans against Israel and the Trump peace proposal.\n\u201cThe occupation will not enjoy calm for too long,\u201d said Sa\u2019di A\u2019abed, a spokesman for the various political factions that participated in the demonstration. \u201cAs our people erupted in an uprising in 1987, so will they surprise the occupier and the world with a new wave of struggle that no one expected.\u201d\nDemonstrations were also scheduled later Wednesday in the West Bank, which is experiencing a big surge in coronavirus cases. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority has said it will evaluate how to respond to annexation if Israel takes action.\nFor more than 50 years, Israeli leaders have refrained from annexation, in part because of the opposition it would draw globally. Netanyahu suddenly turned it into a campaign issue last year in the midst of a close-fought election race where he sought to siphon off right-wing votes from other nationalist parties.\nIsraeli Defense Chief Says Annexation \u2018Will Wait\u2019 Amid Virus\nThe idea won the backing of the Trump administration, which has endorsed annexation of as much as 30% of the West Bank, where more than 400,000 Jewish settlers live alongside 2.6 million Palestinians. Yet Israeli media have reported that some in Washington don\u2019t want the U.S. to be seen as championing unilateral Israeli action outside a negotiations framework.\nPalestinians have rejected the Trump peace proposal as hopelessly biased in Israel\u2019s favor.\nNetanyahu has also failed to bring round his partner in a power-sharing agreement, Alternate Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benny Gantz. On Monday, Gantz, a former military chief now with overall responsibility for the country\u2019s security, said plans to annex West Bank territory must be put to the side while the country tackles a resurgent coronavirus outbreak.\nNetanyahu fired back, saying annexation \u201cdoesn\u2019t depend\u201d on Gantz, according to Hebrew-language media.

Below are some of the points Page touched on.\nHow would you describe the state of Lyon County during the COVID pandemic?\nI think from the health perspective we\u2019re doing extremely well. The fiscal impacts of being told to close businesses does not put us in a good spot. For our tentative budget we scheduled a 5.75 percent decrease in consolidated tax revenue and no salary increases.\nWhy do you think Lyon County has such a low number of cases?\nPart of it is the geography of the county. We have 2,100 square miles with a lot of windshield time between communities. Number two, we didn\u2019t have a lot of people early on who were traveling. People early on started to shut down and stay home \u2026 The further spread out you are, the more different it makes it for people to spread it.\nDo you have any indication of where the cases are in Lyon County?\nI do, and I\u2019m not able to give any of that information. It comes back to the privacy of the patient who has tested positive. So far, everybody who has been positive has voluntary quarantined.\nWhat sort of feedback are you getting from the public?\nFrom the anti-side, its everything from the government\u2019s an idiot to the board of county commissioners need to take over and put people back to work. On the pro-side, it\u2019s everything from we\u2019re doing a good job to we should have the militia out forcing people to stay home. The problem people don\u2019t understand is that cities and counties are political subdivisions of the state. If the government tells us to do something, we have to do it \u2026 We can\u2019t violate what the governor under emergency declaration tells us what to do.\nDo you have any indication when businesses might start opening?\nThe governor declared the magic day of April 30. The president is apparently coming out with a plan to open up the economy, but there is no hard and fast date set \u2026 The governor had to make some big decisions pretty quickly, but as this has gone on, the communication has gotten better. I imagine from the governor or the president or both, it will be some type of tiered system.\nAre there any county projects that have been put on hold with COVID?\nAs far as the county\u2019s projects, none are on hold, but some are on delay. I have no doubt the animal shelter and senior center will be delayed. Rolling A (wastewater treatment plant in Dayton) enhancements are delayed because of the ability to properly communicate and working through electronic means. Some of our routine maintenance projects have been delayed. Some of the road improvement projects are behind \u2013 we shut the road department down for about two weeks. None of it is critical.\nWhat do you see the long-term impacts being to the county?\nThe biggest is fiscal.

It took a period of years for the economy to slow down and eventually come to a point of significant impact. This was an immediate blow to the economy. When you shut down businesses, there\u2019s a substantial and immediate effect to that ... The difference is the immediate impact.\nIs there anything else you would like to add?\nFrom an emergency management standpoint, I\u2019m very proud of what the Quad-County region has done.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the latest Aus$66 billion announced Sunday brought government and central bank measures to support the economy to Aus$189 billion -- or nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). \"These extraordinary times require extraordinary measures and we face a global challenge like we have never faced before,\" he told reporters in Canberra. \"Today's announcement will provide hope and support for millions of Australians at a time when they need it most.\" Small businesses and non-profits will receive cash subsidies of up to Aus$100,000, unemployment payments will be temporarily doubled and pensioners will receive Aus$750 cash. Workers whose income has fallen by at least 20 percent due to the coronavirus outbreak will be able to access their retirement funds early, with those facing hardship allowed to withdraw up to Aus$20,000 over two years. Frydenberg said the economic shock was now expected to be \"deeper, wider and longer\" than was believed just 10 days ago and additional measures would be required. The country appears poised to slip into recession as a result of the coronavirus outbreak after a record 29-year run of economic growth. Australia has recorded more than 1,300 cases and seven deaths from COVID-19. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the government was also \"moving immediately\" to recommend against non-essential travel, warning further measures were imminent to deal with localised outbreaks. He said work-related trips, the transport of essential supplies and travel on compassionate grounds could continue but people should cancel any other travel plans ahead of the upcoming Easter school holidays. \"More stronger measures will be coming and they will be coming in more localised areas to deal with outbreaks,\" Morrison said. \"What that means is, what may be necessary in a part of Sydney may not be necessary at all in... other parts of the country.\" Australia has already sealed off its borders, putting in place an unprecedented ban on entry for non-residents in the hope of stemming the rise of COVID-19 infections. Four Australian regions -- the island state of Tasmania, South Australia state, Western Australia state and the Northern Territory -- have also implemented a 14-day self-isolation period for all visitors. Announcing the state's border closure Sunday, Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said he was considering using Rottnest Island -- a popular tourist destination and former Aboriginal prison site -- as a quarantine zone for people who refuse to self-isolate or are unable to do so. New South Wales and Victoria states on Sunday announced a shutdown of non-essential services, with supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations among those businesses that are exempt.

I have made a pledge to keep my community safe,\u201d said Omondi, turning to reprimand a group of children crowded around her for not maintaining social distancing rules.\n\u201cYou see how small and close together the places where we live are. We have to make sure people understand how they can stop corona from spreading. Here, if one person gets it, everyone can.\u201d\nThe mother of three is not a doctor, nurse or medic of any sort - just one of tens of thousands of ordinary African women who, without fanfare, battle the virus in their communities.\nPoorly paid or not at all, these unsung armies of mostly female community health workers have for years doled out advice and health services to families living in remote villages and urban slums who lack formal support.\nRecruited and trained by government and charities - they are found from Kenya to Tanzania, Ethiopia to Malawi, Liberia to South Africa - the women go door to door, dispensing advice on everything from family planning to immunisations.\nNow, as transmission of the new coronavirus spreads, women like Omondi are essential foot soldiers in the war on COVID-19.\nCharities such as Catholic Relief Services, which is supporting coronavirus training for about 5,000 community health volunteers in Kenya, say this workforce is key.\n\u201cCommunity health volunteers are not given the recognition they deserve, but they are important frontline workers. They have a wide range of knowledge and experience from dealing with cholera outbreaks to malaria prevention,\u201d said Moses Orinda, CRS\u2019s senior project officer in Kenya.\n\u201cFor COVID-19, they have the ability to contact trace, provide support to home-based patients and conduct essential prevention and control activities,\u201d Orinda said.\nThe COVID-19 virus has infected close to 10 million people and killed almost half a million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nInitially the virus multiplied more slowly in Africa than in Asia or Europe, but all 54 nations on the continent are now infected, with more than 330,000 cases and over 8,800 deaths combined, says the African Union\u2019s Centre for Disease Control.\nSouth Africa, Egypt and Nigeria have recorded most cases, but experts say true numbers may be much higher as many nations lack reliable diagnostic or testing capabilities.\nWith densely-packed slums, poor access to water, widespread disease and weak health systems, many countries will struggle to control the fast-spreading virus, they add.\n\u201cFor now, Africa still only accounts for a small fraction of cases worldwide,\u201d said Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa director, earlier this month.\n\u201cBut the pace of the spread is quickening. Swift and early action by African countries has helped to keep numbers low, but constant vigilance is needed to stop COVID-19 from overwhelming health facilities.\u201d\nMore than half of African countries have witnessed community transmission - cases where patients have no travel history or known contact with infected people - suggesting the virus is moving undetected in the population, says WHO.\nThis is not hard to believe.\nMany cities are home to sprawling, overcrowded settlements, housing tens of thousands of people, where the key to containing the spread - hand-washing and social distancing - are a luxury.\nIn Kawangware, there is scant access to water or the space for self-isolation. Families of five live in one-room shacks. There is no piped water and households share toilets.\nAccording to the United Nations, only 14% of Kenyans have the facilities to wash their hands at home with soap and water.\nThe warning from WHO is stark: up to 190,000 Africans could die if containment measures such as contact tracing, isolation, personal hygiene and distancing are not improved.\n\u2018INVISIBLE\u2019 ARMIES\nAlready known and respected, community health workers are a perfect first-line response to a pandemic, say health experts.\nRaj Panjabi, of Harvard Medical School and CEO of Last Mile Health, said community health workers showed their value when another deadly virus hit in Liberia.\n\u201cWhen Ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees, informal community providers stepped up to learn the signs and symptoms of Ebola, to team up with nurses and doctors, to go door to door to find the sick and get them into care,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have stopped the epidemic without a ground force of these community members.\u201d\nOne of their key jobs is busting myths and slaying stigmas.\nA belief that only whites get the virus or that it can be cured with hot, sweet tea is rampant, while mass testing is elusive due to the stigma a positive result can carry.\nGovernment health officials say the women have built up trust through years of contact so locals are happy to pay heed.\n\u201cWe know that they can pass messages on which sometimes the government cannot. They live in the same communities and have good social standing, so it is much easier for them to do provide information,\u201d said Catherine Mugo, a sub-county community strategy coordinator at Kenya\u2019s ministry of health.\nMugo isn\u2019t far wrong.\nAs Omondi wends through the knot of narrow alleys that make up Kawangware, residents rush out to greet her, children give chase, and women break off from hanging washing for her advice.\nWhat to do if there is no money for soap?\nBorrowing a bucket, water and bleach, she shows them how to make a safe chlorine solution strong enough to kill the virus.\nSome can\u2019t afford to buy face masks for running errands. Stay home, she orders; send out somebody who does own one.\n\u201cEverlyne is good. She has brought us new information,\u201d said resident Patrick Gitonga. \u201cShe has shown us new ways.\u201d\nHealth professionals and charity workers say governments need to value this workforce - to give them a living wage as well as the personal protective equipment needed to work safely.\nOmondi, who has been working as a community health volunteer for 10 years without pay and is responsible for 100 households in her neighbourhood, would welcome some recognition.\n\u201cHaving a salary or some stipend would be really useful,\u201d said Omondi, whose five-strong family struggles to get by.\n\u201cBut you know, most of us are doing this work because we have something in (our) heart that tells us that we cannot let our neighbour suffer.\u201d\nReporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla and Emeline Wuilbercq, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

The expiration of the program will leave millions of gig workers and the self employed among others, who do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance, without an income.\nEconomists warned this would undercut consumer spending and the overall economy at a time when new cases of the coronavirus are sky-rocketing, especially in the densely populated South and West, and forcing some authorities in these regions to either close businesses again or pause reopenings.\n\u201cThe road ahead for the consumer looks a little foggy and uncertain to say the least,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. \u201cJuly spending faces the headwinds of states closing back down due to the second wave of the coronavirus. August spending is in doubt because those extra $600 a week unemployment checks stop at the end of July.\u201d\nRetail sales rose 7.5% last month after jumping 18.2% in May, which was the biggest gain since the government started tracking the series in 1992. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales advancing 5% in June.\nRetail sales have rebounded as businesses resumed operations after being shuttered in mid-March in an effort to slow the spread of the respiratory illness. Retail sales in June were driven by an 8.2% increase in receipts at auto dealerships. Consumers stepped up spending at furniture, clothing, electronics and appliance, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Receipts at restaurants and bars shot up 20.0%.\nBut online and mail-order retail sales fell 2.4%. Sales also fell at building material and grocery stores.\nStocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid worries about the explosion in coronavirus cases. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 5.6% in June after increasing 10.1% in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the gross domestic product report.\nThe rebound in core retail sales did not change expectations consumer spending collapsed in the second quarter. It, however, set spending on a higher growth path for the third quarter.\nEconomists expect consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, declined at as much as a 35% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. That could result in GDP falling at around a 31% pace in that period. The economy shrank at a 5% pace in the January-March quarter, the sharpest contraction since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.\n\u201cActivity snapped back in May and June, albeit to levels below those which prevailed prior to the pandemic,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan in New York. \u201cMore recently, several high-frequency indicators suggest that May and June were the easy months, and that the resurgence of COVID-19 cases is leading to slower activity gains in July.\u201d\nSeparately on Thursday, the Labor Department said 1.30 million people filed for state unemployment benefits during the week ending July 11, down 10,000 from the prior period. Economists had forecast 1.250 million claims last week.\nThe weekly jobless claims report, the most timely data on the economy\u2019s health, showed big increases in California, Georgia, Florida and Washington state, which are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases.\nFirst-time claims peaked at a historic 6.867 million in late March. They remain roughly double their highest point during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Including a program funded by the government, 2.23 million people filed claims last week.\nThe number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 422,000 to 17.338 million in the week ending July 4. These so-called continued claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, topped out at a record 24.912 million in early May.\nThere were 32 million people receiving unemployment checks under all programs in the last week of June, down 433,005 from the prior week. According to economists, this number, which is reported with a two-week lag, offered a more accurate reading of the labor market.\nEconomists say unemployment remains uncomfortably high because of a second wave of layoffs, which could intensify as the COVID-19 infections depress demand and increase bankruptcies, especially in the retail sector. American Airlines said on Wednesday it was sending 25,000 notices of potential furloughs to frontline workers.\n\u201cThe data are likely underestimating the true state of the labor market,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. \u201cFirms are starting to warn there could be major layoffs in the months to come.\u201d\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200714-19397", "label": -1, "title": "Singapore's economy contracts 12.6% year over year in the second quarter", "body": "Singapore's economy contracted by 12.6% in the second quarter compared to a year ago, according to advance estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry released Tuesday.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had expected the Southeast Asian economy to shrink by 10.5% year-over-year in the three months ended June 30.\nIn the first quarter, the Singapore economy registered a 0.7% contraction , according to the ministry.\nThe economic performance in the second quarter worsened due to the implementation of partial lockdown measures \u2014 which the Singapore government called a \"circuit breaker\" \u2014 aimed at reducing the spread of the coronavirus.\nThose measures, which started in early April, involved shutting most workplaces (except those offering essential services) and closing all schools temporarily.

For the first time, the police deployed water cannon, tear gas and pepper spray, marking the end of the relatively peaceful phase in protesting that made Bulgaria such an outlier in Europe in this regard.\nThe following day the embattled government used the clashes as an excuse to stop negotiating its exit from power. As Member of Parliament Toma Bikov from the ruling GERB party put it on September 3, \"after [the events of] yesterday, we can no longer discuss the resignation of the government. This would mean resigning after attacks by criminals.\"\nSo what led to these dramatic events and what is next for the Bulgarian protest movement?\nSince the beginning of 2020, a series of localised crises and scandals built up tension in the public sphere and led to an explosive protest wave against GERB's almost uninterrupted 10-year rule. The winter was marked by a water crisis caused by the drying up of several dams, the most serious of which took place in the town of Pernik, 45km southwest of Sofia. The water shortage happened due to lack of maintenance of vital infrastructure and government leniency towards large industries abusing local water reserves.\nThen came the coronavirus pandemic and the government's abysmal handling of the situation, which saw doctors resigning due to the lack of protective gear and inadequate emergency measures in place. Then a series of scandals revealed corrupt schemes involving lucrative property along the Black Sea coast. The most notable case was of the Aleppu beach where a landslide cleared the ground for a luxury hotel right on the beach, which the authorities claimed was merely a \"fortification wall\". This angered the Bulgarian public, which has been reeling over the reckless overdevelopment of the Black Sea coast for years.\nThe early summer was also marked by thunderous reshuffling within the ranks of the ruling oligarchy and businessmen close to them, leading to the fall from grace of Vassil Bozhkov, one of the richest gambling, tourism and construction bosses in Bulgaria, followed by a full-blown turf war which spilled over into the public sphere in the shape of leaks.\nCandid photographs of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov sleeping in his bedroom next to a drawer packed full of 500-euro bills, gold bars and a gun were leaked to the media. The prime minister did not deny the authenticity of the pictures but claimed the money was planted.\nThen, the Anti-Corruption Fund, an NGO documenting and investigating high-level corruption, released a documentary about an insidious scheme for stealing high-profile businesses with the help of the judiciary.\nIn July 2020, Hristo Ivanov, co-leader of the liberal coalition \"Democratic Bulgaria\" and judicial reform activist, transformed the intra-elite war into a \"civil war\" of sorts by disembarking on the illegally enclosed beach, surrounding the seafront mansion of Ahmed Dogan, the honorary leader of the liberal Movement for Rights and Liberties (DPS), which claims to represent the ethnic minorities in Bulgaria but is widely known as one of the most corrupt parties.\nIvanov and his crew were brutally pushed back by security guards who refused to reveal if they work for the National Security Service (NSS), a government agency tasked with providing personal security to senior politicians and state functionaries. The skirmish caused an outcry, augmented by the intervention of the Bulgarian President Rumen Radev who confirmed that the security guards are indeed employees of the NSS and were appointed in violation of their mandate.\nThe chief prosecutor, Ivan Geshev, whom the opposition has accused of aiding and abetting corruption by refusing to press charges against politicians and businessmen, reacted immediately by ordering a raid on the presidency, in blatant violation of all constitutionally sanctioned immunity guarantees and separation of powers.\nThe following day, on July 9, the first mass protest took place in Sofia.\nDespite the liberal views professed by its organisers, the protest attracted people from across the political spectrum, including President Radev's supporters from the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), BSP splinters, the extra-parliamentary and the radical left, not to mention apolitical hipsters, artists and even turbo-folk singers.\nThis is quite unprecedented given that liberals and the left have always defined themselves in vitriolic mutual opposition to each other, but it seems that GERB and their junior coalition partners from the far right achieved the unachievable - uniting literally everybody against them.\nThe protests voiced three main demands: the resignation of the ruling coalition and the chief prosecutor, early elections and then judicial reform through constitutional amendments. In a sleight of hand, the governing party changed the order of the demands and in August stunned everybody by declaring they have drafted a new constitution to fulfil the demand for change.\nBorisov tied his resignation to the constitutional amendments, explaining that if the party does not manage to collect the signatures of 50 percent of the MPs (or 120 people) by September 2 - the minimum quota required for the Parliament to begin discussing the draft - he will resign.\nNotwithstanding the vague promise of resignation, the protesters were infuriated. The constitutional draft was full of mistakes, grammatical as well as technical; it envisioned some worrying changes, perceived as attempts to entrench the governing party's hold on power, such as reducing the number of MPs. It also removed constitutional guarantees for the equality between men and women replacing them with pro-natalist and \"family values\" paragraphs.\nIn two nerve-racking weeks of negotiations, Borisov's proposal finally gathered 122 signatures by the September 2 deadline, with the help of the populist party of fuel and pharmacy tycoon Veselin Mareshki. The following day it was revealed that a company linked to Mareshki clinched a lucrative 20-year beach concession.\nIn effect, Borisov's constitutional exercise aimed at buying him time in power. This infuriated the protesters and on September 2, the largest crowds since the beginning of the crisis gathered in central Sofia.\nIn the evening, however, some protesters thought to be paid provocateurs, started throwing small fireworks at the police, which eventually provoked a violent response, as officers launched into the crowd, beating people with batons and using tear gas and water cannon. Some 100 people were arrested, many were badly beaten, including at least one journalist who produced his press card but was not spared from the police violence.\nThe explanations police chiefs later gave about this unheard-of deployment of police force caused an outcry and fuelled conspiracy narratives that the police had let the provocateurs off the hook to have an excuse to attack the protesters.\nThese events put the habitual understanding of the state as a neutral arbiter to the test. The Bulgarian elite is deeply divided and warring factions wield their power over the state as a weapon against their competitors.\nThese intra-class clashes sometimes spill over from the \"backroom\" and reach us via the incessant stream of corruption scandals, leaked photos and recordings, surprise arrests of businessmen who fall out of favour, and even the nationalisation of private businesses. But the violent change of positions within the ruling elite and the elimination of competitors erodes the state.\nDespite the boost the liberal coalition of Hristo Ivanov got from the protests, it is unlikely that the party will solve this problem within the narrow legalistic reform framework it proposes (judicial reform and depoliticisation of the general prosecution).\nThe power of the oligarchy needs to be undercut not only \"from above\", ie via more stringent criminal and anti-corruption legislation, but also from \"below\", from the foundations. Money is power and the more wealth one accumulates privately, the greater its gravity, warping and bending the public sphere and the political life to the benefit of its owners.\nTherefore, their power must be undercut by economic reforms, too, such as the long overdue abolition of the flat tax regime put in place by a BSP-DPS government in 2008, which funnels money from the bottom to the top, concentrating economic power in the hands of a few business circles.\nBulgaria also needs \u0430 more robust welfare state that can make working people less dependent on the oligarchs for their livelihood. That is why it is great news that left-wing forces are also part of the protest. However weak their voice still is, it is nonetheless important to keep pushing for \"social\" solutions to corruption and mafia rule.\nThe war against corruption must also be a battle over definitions. Without the notion of social justice to supplement the liberal ideas about rule of law and judicial reform, the lofty calls for justice animating the protest stand a lesser chance of resonating with the majority of the Bulgarian population, whose main concern is socioeconomic survival.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"RECORDID": "20200520-37493", "label": 1, "title": "COVID-19: Travellers allowed to transit through Changi Airport gradually from 2 June", "body": "SINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore will gradually allow travelers to transit through Changi Airport from 2 June, when Phase 1 of the country\u2019s reopening begins amid the pandemic.\nCurrently, transit through Singapore is limited to foreign passengers who are on repatriation flights arranged by their governments.

Depending on their size and payroll, owners of businesses can get loans of up to $10 million to cover about eight weeks of payroll and other qualified overhead expenses such as rent and utilities.\nIf they spend the proceeds on these uses, the loans are fully refundable by the Treasury.

Scientists already knew that once the virus breaks into a cell, it forms double-membrane sacs, or vesicles, in which it makes copies of its genetic material. But the sacs appeared to be closed and it was previously unclear how the genetic material moved from the sac into the fluid in the cell, where new virus particles assembled themselves. Eric Snijder of Leiden University Medical Center and his colleagues discovered tiny channels through both membranes that are wide enough to let the genetic material pass through. \"In electron microscope images we can see 'stuff' sticking out of these channels. Most likely this 'stuff' is the viral RNA on its way out, but as the sample is frozen, there is no movement and we still need to find ways to properly identify the 'stuff' as viral RNA,\" Snijder told Reuters. \"Blocking this channel somehow...could create a big problem for the virus to do its tricks,\" he added.

A separate study from the Mayo Clinic, posted online ahead of peer review, found that people who received other vaccines in the past 5 years - such as against flu, pneumonia, or hepatitis - had lower coronavirus infection rates. Netea said the Mayo Clinic report suggests the \"beneficial effects of vaccines may be broader than currently known\" and that his team had seen similar data on flu vaccines.

The researchers studied 303 young and otherwise healthy patients isolated in a community treatment center in the Republic of Korea. Roughly a third had no symptoms when they were diagnosed, and about 20% of this group developed symptoms while isolated. Multiple tests over the course of about a month showed similar viral loads in people with or without symptoms. The tests could not distinguish active, or infectious, virus particles from inactive particles. \"For a better understanding of the viral shedding and potential transmissibility of asymptomatic infection, large rigorous epidemiologic and experimental studies are needed,\" the researchers wrote.

So if you\u2019re big on Asian cuisine, stocking up on herbs is of paramount importance. So instead of continually buying your herbs, why not grow them yourself? Read on to learn about which Asian herbs to grow in your home, and how. It can even be a simple science project for you and the kids!\n7 Asian Herbs To Grow At Home\n1. Lemongrass\nLemongrass, as its name implies, has a fresh, citrusy flavour. It\u2019s used in plenty of Asian cuisines, especially Thai and Chinese cooking. You can boil lemongrass to create a soothing tea that\u2019s also said to relieve bloating and boost oral health. People also use lemongrass oil as a bug repellent, and also to promote sleep and relieve pain.\nHow to grow lemongrass at home\nGrowing lemongrass indoors is relatively easy, which makes it one of the best Asian herbs to grow at home. All you need is to buy lemongrass with green centres and the bulbs still intact. Place the bulb in a glass with just a few inches of water and wait a few weeks \u2014 but don\u2019t forget to change the water frequently.\nOnce the new roots begin to grow, plant it a large container with moist (not wet) potting mix, as lemongrass spreads and grows pretty tall (a few feet high). Make sure that the container has enough drainage holes. Keep your pot under the sun \u2014 if you don\u2019t have a garden, keep it somewhere with plenty of natural sunlight.\nWater and fertilise your lemongrass plant frequently, and once it grows, don\u2019t be afraid to harvest it frequently as well. This encourages new growth and keeps your plant healthy, so you\u2019ll have more reason to cook yummy Asian food!\n2. Vietnamese mint\nAs its name implies, Vietnamese mint is a peppery herb used in plenty of Vietnamese dishes, from pho to salads to deep-fried pork. Vietnamese mint is also traditionally used to reduce fever, to reduce inflammation, to improve skin conditions, to reduce nausea, and much more.\nHow to grow Vietnamese mint at home\nTo grow Vietnamese mint, your best bet is to use clippings. Buy a plant from a nursery or grocery, cut a 15cm stem from the plant, and pull off the bottom leaves. Then, place the cutting in a glass of water until it grows roots. This process should take around 3-4 weeks \u2014 don\u2019t forget to change the water periodically!\nThen, transfer the plant to a spot with partial shade. You can fill a large pot with loamy, slightly acidic soil to help your plant flourish, then place it next to a window. Though it\u2019s native to the tropics, as long as you keep your Vietnamese plant warm and damp, it should do well.\nWater your plant frequently, keeping the soil consistently moist. You can also fertilise your plant with liquid seaweed fertiliser every month \u2014 twice a month during warmer months, and once a month during cooler months. Don\u2019t fertilise more than twice a month, as this can ruin the taste. Wait a month before harvesting with gardening shears \u2014 but wait until the plant is dry until you do so.\n3. Coriander\nAlso known as cilantro or Chinese parsley, coriander is used in cooking all over the globe, from Mexico to Thailand. Coriander is also used to relieve digestion problems, as well as to treat infections and other pains.\nHow to grow coriander at home\nCoriander is one of the tougher Asian herbs to grow at home, but if you give it the proper TLC, you can have coriander fresh from the garden all year round. Coriander thrives in weather that\u2019s not too cool but not too warm either. The best time to plant coriander in tropical climates is during cooler, dry times. Coriander grows best in a garden, but if you\u2019re growing it in a pot, choose a large one as they grow big taproots.\nAfter filling the post with fast-draining soil and some fertilizer, moisten the soil and sprinkle the seeds over the soil evenly. Then cover with half a centimeter of soil. Cilantro needs a lot of sun to grow, so place your cilantro in a sunny windowsill if you\u2019re keeping it indoors. It should take your seeds around two to three weeks to germinate.\nUse a spray bottle to keep the soil moist \u2014 pouring water might displace the seeds, and coriander hates being moved around. Once the coriander stems reach 10-15cm, you can harvest them by cutting up to two-thirds of the leaves every week.\n4. Thai basil\nThai basil has a lovely fresh, aromatic, liquorice-y taste that\u2019s a lot stronger than its Italian counterpart. It\u2019s used in plenty of Southeast Asian dishes, from curries to salads. Thai basil is also traditionally used to relieve digestive problems like constipation and gas.\nHow to grow Thai basil at home\nYou can buy Thai basil plants from the nursery or plant them as a seed. Thai basil plants are usually planted outdoors, but it\u2019s a low-maintenance plant that can also flourish indoors, provided they get enough light.\nUse well-drained, nutrient soil that should be kept moist, not soggy. If you\u2019re growing your Thai basil plant indoors, make sure that you fertilize it regularly. Basil requires at least six hours of natural sunlight or 10 hours of fluorescent lights, so keep it in a well-lit place.\n5. Garlic chives\nGarlic chives look like chives but taste like garlic, hence the name. Also called Chinese chives, they\u2019re used in plenty of Chinese dishes, and even herbal vinegars, cheeses, and compound butters.\nHow to grow garlic chives at home\nChives are pretty easy to grow \u2014 just make sure that they\u2019re watered regularly. Fertilizing them at the beginning of their growing season is also a good idea. To foster new growth, prune the stems regularly, clipping either all the way to the ground or with 2 inches remaining.\n6. Kaffir lime leaves\nA key ingredient in Southeast-Asian cuisine, kaffir lime leaves are very aromatic and flavorful. They\u2019re used in plenty of Thai recipes, such as green curry and chicken fried rice. The acidic kaffir lime isn\u2019t normally consumed, but is used to produce household cleaning products.\nHow to grow a kaffir lime tree at home\nTo grow a kaffir lime tree at home, you can start by planting a seedling in a 6 to 9-inch pot, but a 2-3 year-old plant needs a 10-14 inch pot to thrive.\nKeep the seedling in an outdoor area that gives it full sun for at least eight hours a day, but shields the tree from wind exposure. Let the soil dry completely before giving it a 6-inch deep watering once or twice a week. If you notice yellowing leaves, that means you are over watering your plant.\n7. Ginger\nGinger is used all kinds of cuisine, making it a great Asian herb to grow at home. Ginger is also used to relieve nausea, and when boiled into a tea, can soothe a sore throat.\nHow to grow ginger at home\nGrowing ginger at home is pretty easy. First, get yourself a living ginger root from a nursery or garden centre. Choose a firm, plump root with tight skin and several buds. Cut the root in sections per bud \u2014 these will grow into individual plants.\nSoak the ginger root in warm water overnight, then plant it eye bud pointing up in a shallow, wide plant pot, because ginger roots grow horizontally. Cover the root with 1-2 inches of soil. Place the pot in a warm spot that\u2019s not exposed to too much bright light, and keep the soil moist, but don\u2019t overwater.\nIt will take a while before you can enjoy your first harvest, so be patient. After 2-3 weeks, you should see some shoots, and after a few months, you can harvest small pieces of ginger. Cut out small amounts of stems at the edge of the pot and replace the soil so it keeps growing.\nWhat herbs to grow at home are you gonna get started with?"}, {"RECORDID": "20200921-20288", "label": -1, "title": "U.K. at \u2018Critical Point\u2019 in Virus Surge With London at Risk", "body": "(Bloomberg) --\nBritain is at a \u201ccritical point\u201d in the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be told on Monday, as concern mounts that a second lockdown may be needed to stop the renewed spread of the disease.\nChief Medical Officer Chris Whitty plans to sound the alert, saying U.K. data are heading in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d according to a preview of remarks prepared for a public briefing.\nThe warning comes amid expectations that local restrictions could soon be extended to London.

Gore in his crusade against mail-in voting", "body": "President Donald Trump's lawyers are trying to revive the Supreme Court decision that awarded George W. Bush the presidency in 2000 to fight mail-in voting practices for the upcoming presidential election.\nThe 5-4 ruling in Bush v. Gore ended a 36-day ordeal after the Florida results were too close to call. The dispute featured battalions of lawyers that descended on the state, challenged ballots with \"hanging chads,\" and multiple recounts under the glare of national television. Although the case still resonates politically, haunting close elections, its legal principle has long been regarded as a proverbial ticket good for one ride only. The Supreme Court itself has not cited the case in any ruling since then.\nStill, as tensions rise over mail-in ballots, Trump persists with his unsupported assertions of fraudulent voting, and his legal team newly raises Bush v. Gore, some Democratic lawyers wonder whether the case may become less like the single-ride ticket and more like the axiomatic principle that, in the words of the late Justice Robert H. Jackson, \" lies about like a loaded weapon ready \" to be brought forward in a moment of need.\nIf the Trump campaign's new legal approach succeeds, it could lead to the mass discarding of votes in November, a prospect that has drawn concern from some Democrats as states increasingly encourage vote-by-mail options because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nA CNN poll released last week found that Trump supporters overwhelmingly preferred to vote in person (66%), while supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden said they would rather vote by mail (53%, as opposed to 22% in person).\nWhen the high court stopped the Florida recounts in 2000, giving the Republican Texas Gov. Bush the White House over Democratic Vice President Al Gore, it declared that county standards for assessing the intentions of voters on disputed ballots varied too widely to be fair. The court said the variations violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee.\nYet the conservative five-justice majority also described its opinion in Bush v. Gore as \"limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.\"\nAs a result, legal commentators have long viewed Bush v. Gore as a decision born of the political moment rather than one offering a solid precedent. Lower court judges have only sporadically referred to the case.\nTrump campaign lawyers believe the case has new salience. They rely on Bush v. Gore in new lawsuits against mail-in voting in Nevada and New Jersey , most prominently in the Nevada case. They assert that states lack uniform procedures for balloting by mail in violation of constitutional equal protection.\nIn the Nevada lawsuit against the secretary of state, lawyer William Consovoy, who has been at the vanguard of much of Trump's litigation, wrote that the mail-in regulations lack \"minimal procedural safeguards\" and constitute \"unequal standardless treatment of Nevada voters across counties.\"\nThe new legal arguments echo Trump's broader and unfounded attacks on mail-in voting as fraudulent. Multiple studies have found that widespread fraud in US elections does not exist. Still, there has been an acceleration of Trump claims on multiple fronts as some states prepare to send out ballots next month.\nConsovoy declined to comment on the Trump campaign's litigation strategy or the use of Bush v. Gore.\n\nThe Bush v. Gore saga proved how a close, contentious race could tear apart the country, even in a less polarized time.\nAt stake two decades ago were Florida's 25 electoral votes, which by the end of the November 7, 2000, election day were expected to determine who would be president. The race was too tight to call that night, although some news networks did declare Gore the winner of Florida, then Bush, then simply said they did not know. Gore even conceded the race to Bush, only to call and reverse himself.\nVideo: Former Trump campaign chair Steve Bannon charged with fraud (CNN)\nPresident Trump takes questions from reporters for first time since Election Day\nComing Up on 'Fox News Sunday': November 29\nMaria Bartiromo to interview Trump on Sunday, his first since Election Day\nAstronaut shows Earth from SpaceX Crew Dragon\nMilitary police commander surprises children\nExperts unpack situation in Iran escalating as Biden takes office\nOn the site of the army barracks where Ethiopia's conflict began\nIran vows revenge after top nuclear scientist killed\nTrump era shows \u2018Constitution stronger than one man\u2019 expert says\nUK police arrest 60 in anti-lockdown protests\nIf Biden didn't win, how is GA runoff a check on Dem White House?\nRep.

As recounts began, the tallies shifted. A Florida state certification in late November, issued by a Republican secretary of state, put Bush ahead by a mere 357 votes out of nearly 6 million ballots cast.\nAmong the indelible images as recounts played out on national television were officials scrutinizing \"hanging\" and \"dimpled\" chads to discern voters' intentions on a ballot and the \"Brooks Brothers riot\" at Miami-Dade County election office disrupting the recounts. It all ended just after 10 p.m. ET on December 12, with another memorable image, as news reporters raced across the Supreme Court's marble plaza, the court's decision in hand, to awaiting TV cameras.\nThe justices declined to take the bench to announce their unsigned opinion permanently stopping the Florida recounts. The same five-justice conservative majority had temporarily blocked the recounts three days earlier, also over protests from liberal dissenters.\nThe final decision found that Florida standards for assessing contested ballots varied from county to county resulting in \"arbitrary and disparate treatment\" among voters.\nIn the majority were Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.\nThat familiar conservative-liberal lineup stoked complaints of partisan politics.\nStevens, the senior liberal at the time, wrote: \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\"\nThe high court has not referred to Bush v. Gore in any subsequent ruling, according to a search of the court's website that includes the texts of cases. The single case citation appears passingly in a footnote in a solo dissenting opinion by Thomas in a 2013 Arizona voter-registration dispute.\nStill, in a purely neutral vein, the case would have as much precedential value as any other Supreme Court decision and litigants would be free to use it, if they believed it persuasive to make their case.\nThomas is one of three justices (with Ginsburg and Breyer) still on the bench from 2000. Two justices who joined years later happened to have worked as lawyers with the Bush team in Florida: John Roberts , named chief justice by Bush in 2005, and Brett Kavanaugh , appointed by Trump in 2018.\n\n\nThe Trump campaign lawsuits invoking Bush v. Gore were brought by the Consovoy McCarthy law firm that has taken the lead on myriad Trump litigation, including the President's effort to prevent his tax returns from being turned over to a Manhattan grand jury.\nIn the Nevada claim filed in on August 4, Consovoy particularly protested rules that would allow some late ballots to be counted and, separately, that require different numbers of polling places in urban and rural areas based on county population.\nNevada state officials have asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. A US district court judge has yet to rule on that motion.\nThe Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Nevada Democratic Party were allowed to intervene in the Nevada case, under a US district court order issued Friday. In their motion asking to intervene, the Democratic groups had declared the Trump lawsuit \"a hodgepodge of claims\" that are not \"viable.\"\nSubmitted by lawyer Marc Elias, a veteran of many Democratic campaign battles, the motion describes the Trump lawsuit as \"an attempt to undermine the state's effort ... to protect Nevada voters during a public health crisis.\"\nA separate federal court complaint from the Trump campaign was lodged against New Jersey on Tuesday, after Gov. Phil Murphy declared that all residents would be mailed ballots for voting this November. Residents may still vote in person but through provisional paper ballots to be checked for duplicate voting.\nThe Trump campaign presents numerous legal grounds, including those based on Bush v. Gore's equal-protection rationale. Murphy's order, Trump lawyers assert, \"will result in New Jersey's counties using varying standards to determine what is a legal provisional vote.\"\nOverall, the complaint echoes Trump's public message trying to discredit mail-in ballots. It refers to potential voter fraud dozens of times and warns that the New Jersey plan arising from a public health crisis presents \"a recipe for disaster.\"\nAs Trump continues to challenge mail-in voting, it is not difficult to imagine more Bush v. Gore-inspired litigation and even a possible replay of the milestone case in the guise of Trump v. Biden. How the current Supreme Court would rule defies ready prediction, beyond the likelihood that Chief Justice Roberts would play a crucial role as he has in the most recent important cases.\nFor years, Scalia famously admonished the divided nation regarding Bush v.

Regulatory approval of the drug would clear the way for commercial sales.\n\u201cWe are working to build a global consortium of pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers to expand global capacity and production,\u201d Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O\u2019Day said in an open letter on Wednesday.\nHe also said Gilead is looking at ways to potentially bring the treatment to a broader patient population by investigating other formulations and means of delivery.\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, said partial results from its 1,063-patient trial show that hospitalized COVID-19 patients given remdesivir recovered in 11 days, compared to 15 days for patients given a placebo.\nThe study showed a trend toward better survival for remdesivir - 8% of patients given the drug died compared with 11.6% in the placebo group - but the difference was not statistically significant so may not be due to Gilead\u2019s drug.\nThe trial\u2019s lead researcher told Reuters on Friday that full results could come by mid-May.\n\u201cThe full dataset will provide more clarity on how remdesivir can best be used,\u201d said Dr. Aneesh Mehta, a researcher on the NIH trial from Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\u2018GLIMMER OF HOPE\u2019\nDespite the excitement, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, global fellow at The Wilson Center in Washington, DC, was not ready to celebrate the preliminary findings.\nThe new data \u201coffers a glimmer of hope\u201d that remdesivir has an effect against COVID-19, but more scientific analysis is needed \u201ccomparing them to other studies of the drug that have shown mixed results,\u201d he said in a statement.\nAlso on Wednesday, results were published by the Lancet medical journal of a trial conducted in China that concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients\u2019 condition or reduce the pathogen\u2019s presence in the bloodstream. Gilead said previously that those findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.\n\u201cThe drug seems to have antiviral activity - how much is as yet unclear,\u201d Dr. Daniel McQuillen, an infectious disease specialist at Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts, told Reuters. \u201cSeems likely that it might need use with another antiviral agent.\u201d\nCombination antiviral treatments have proven highly effective against other diseases.\nGilead also provided data on a study in severe COVID-19 patients it has conducted in dozens of medical centers, which does not have a placebo comparison but tested the drug under five-day and 10-day regimens.\nIn that 397-patient trial, Gilead said clinical improvements were similar regardlesss of treatment duration, and patients treated early on with remdesivir did better than patients who were treated later in the course of infection.\nRemdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host\u2019s immune system.\nThe company is also studying the drug in patients with less severe COVID-19, but those results are not expected until later next month.\nAdditional reporting by Timothy Ahmann and Steve Holland in Washington, D.C. and Carl O\u2019Donnell in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot and Lincoln Feast.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200914-67239", "label": -1, "title": "'Will Parliament Discuss Serious Issues like China, Coronavirus?'

While his constituent was able to video chat her friends and family, Schickel\u00a0agreed with her suggestion that isolation from family at the end of one\u2019s life was worth than death itself.\n\u201cShe said something that I knew in my heart was right,\u201d Schickel said. \u201cShe said \u2018John, there's worse things than dying.\u2019 And what she was trying to tell me without saying it was, she felt like she may die without her family.

That's because border restrictions are tightening in many countries and Canadians abroad could face problems accessing affordable health care.\n\"If people do become ill, it is much better to become ill in your own home country, where you know that you have appropriate health coverage,\" said federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu.\nSome travellers have protected themselves with medical insurance, but there's a risk it will run out if they extend their stay.\nSince Canada has advised against non-essential international travel due to the coronavirus, many insurance companies are refusing to extend medical coverage beyond a traveller's original return date, said insurance broker Martin Firestone.\nFirestone said he's had to break that news to many of his snowbird clients who want to remain in a warmer climate during the pandemic.\n\"I'm dealing with people who want to stay, believing the germs are going to die in the heat, and they need [medical insurance] extensions. And that's now become very difficult for me to accommodate,\" said Firestone, who works for Travel Secure in Toronto.\nSlade doesn't have medical insurance, but said he's not worried because he believes any hospital costs in Cuba would be minimal and he trusts the country's national health care.\n\"The excellent health-care system is prepped and ready for the inevitable expansion of this nasty disease,\" he said.\nRiskier to stay or leave?\nFirestone said Canadians shouldn't risk travelling without medical insurance \u2014 even when there is no pandemic.\nLili Hrabchak of Toronto agrees, which is why the snowbird purchased insurance before travelling with her husband to their winter home in Rotonda West, Fla., back in November.\nBut she recently learned that coverage is set to run out \u2014 before Hrabchak's planned departure date of April 7. In response to the government's travel advisory, her insurance provider, Johnson, announced that its clients' medical coverage will last until March 23, or however long it takes them to immediately return home.\nThis upset Hrabchak, who isn't ready to return to Canada.\nHer husband, Todd, is 85 years old and suffers from health complications due to a recent stroke. She worries if they fly back by March 23, he risks picking up the virus at a crowded airport or on a crowded flight, as many other travellers rush home, too.\n\"I feel like there's a gun to my head, telling me you have to leave, no matter how foolish it is,\" Hrabchak, 71, said Tuesday.\nShe said she was trying to decide which move was riskier: staying in Florida without medical insurance or heading home.\n\"It is like playing Russian roulette.\"\nIt turns out, she won't have to make that difficult decision.\nShortly after Hrabchak made her case to her provider Wednesday morning, she was informed that her medical insurance will last until April 7, and can be extended further if necessary.\n\"I am over the moon happy,\" said Hrabchak, who encourages any snowbird in a similar situation to contact their insurance provider.\nPressure from the kids\nSandy Munro and his wife, Lynn, are also defying the government's recommendation to return home immediately.\nThe snowbirds are spending the winter in Venice, Fla., and plan to drive back to Canada when their medical insurance expires on April 6 \u2014 but not a day sooner.

Operating like an early stage biotechnology company, DRIVE applies focus and industry development expertise to efficiently translate discoveries to address viruses of global concern. DRIVE's mission is to discover and develop antiviral drugs for emerging infections, pandemic threats, and biodefense (e.g. COVID-19, swine flu, bird flu, dengue, chikungunya, Ebola, Zika, and viral encephalitis). Because these diseases are major threats, antiviral drugs are critically needed to treat them; however, they are generally not profitable enough for industry to pursue, and thus are considered neglected diseases. DRIVE is unique in that it brings industry expertise to the assets of a leading research University to develop potential antiviral drugs to a de-risked value inflection point that substantially increases the probability of the potential drug being licensed by industry and developed for the ultimate benefit of the public. DRIVE's executive team, led by George Painter , has over three decades of drug development experience within both large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including leading the development of multiple FDA approved antivirals to treat HIV and Influenza, among other viral diseases, including AZT and Relenza.\nAbout Defense Threat Reduction Agency:\nThe Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) was formally established on October 1 , 1998. DTRA enables the Department of Defense, the United States Government and International partners to counter and deter weapons of mass destruction and improvised threat networks.

They have no symptoms, South Korea Health Minister Kim Kang-lip told a briefing.\nJapanese passengers who test negative will begin disembarking as early as Wednesday, the original deadline for the end of ship\u2019s quarantine, Japan Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said.\n\u201cEveryone wants to return home as soon as possible, so considering that feeling, we are making preparations smoothly, so that they can go back to their home,\u201d Kato told reporters."}, {"RECORDID": "20200711-22579", "label": -1, "title": "How Sweden And Portugal Went From Pandemic Role Models To Record Infections", "body": "The decision to exclude Portugal from the UK\u2019s list of quarantine-exempt countries last week came as a shock to British holidaymakers. Until recently, with its high testing rates , low death toll and political unity, Portugal was the model to follow to defeat coronavirus. In June, however, up to 700,000 Portuguese were suddenly forced back into lockdown .\nIn May, the World Health Organisation (WHO) congratulated Swedish society for keeping the virus at bay without going into lockdown . But come July, serious questions are being raised about the way the Scandinavian country is managing Covid-19.\nOn June 24th, the only two countries in Europe with areas where there were more than 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the previous 14 days were Sweden and, far behind it, Portugal.\nWhile the WHO recently praised the action of Spain and Italy for turning around the bad epidemiological situation they had started from, just a few days ago the agency included Sweden on a list of 11 European countries where the coronavirus had recently made a resurgence.\nSweden, far from making efforts to try to reverse the situation, replied that the WHO report was a \u201d total misinterpretation of the data\u201d since the Scandinavian country is now testing more, hence more cases are being detected, argued Anders Tegnell, the Swedish state epidemiologist.\n\u201cIt seems a bit arrogant, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d says Manuel Felices, a Spanish surgeon and head of the surgery department at the N\u00c4L hospital, north of Gothenburg, Sweden. The country is also accused of arrogance by its other Scandinavian neighbours, where there has been a total of 1,200 deaths out of a population of 17 million, while in Sweden there have been over 5,000 deaths out of a population of 10 million.\n\u201cThe virus has been underestimated,\u201d says Felices. This statement, which could apply to almost everywhere in the world, is perhaps more appropriate in Sweden, taking into account that the government not only refused from the start to lock down the population, but also that at this point it is still not recommending the use of face masks nor extending the quarantine to those who live with infected people. \u201cIt has been, and is, a huge mistake, in my opinion, to fail to consider the contagious potential of presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients, whose role in spreading is still not officially admitted in Sweden,\u201d says Felices. \u201cThe recommendations are based on \u2018if you have symptoms, stay at home.\u2019 So much so that family members who have a confirmed case among them, but who do not have symptoms, are not obliged to quarantine,\u201d he explains. \nThe Portuguese attitude could not be more different from the Swedish one in this sense. Portugal did lock down its population in mid-March, just 11 days after recording the first case of COVID-19, and it \u201creopened\u201d the country two months later, when the situation was considered to be under control. The reopening of economic activity and relaxation of the restrictive measures resulted in a rise in cases of the virus, mainly in the Lisbon region, where last week 19 districts in the Lisbon metropolitan area were ordered to quarantine.\nThe appearance of outbreaks with the economic reactivation is not new, but the act of locking down 700,000 people \u2013 who for two weeks (June 29 - July 12) will only be able to leave their homes to work, buy food and medicine, and exercise \u2013 came as quite a shock to Europe, and especially to Spain. While continuing to look at its neighbour out of the corner of its eye, in case the story could be repeated there, Spain has seen its worst fears come true after the El Segri\u00e0 district in Lleida and A Mari\u00f1a district in Lugo went back into lockdown last weekend.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in Portugal is going to become the norm in most countries,\u201d Jo\u00e3o J\u00falio Cerqueira said in an email to HuffPost Spain. According to the Portuguese doctor, a specialist in occupational medicine and creator of the Evidence-Based Medicine Project (SCIMED), \u201cthere will be outbreaks of infections that will have to be dealt with by the authorities to mitigate the spread of the illness following the reopening of the economy. In that sense, there\u2019s nothing abnormal.\u201d\nFor Cerqueira, \u201ceverything depends on how the government acts to contain those outbreaks,\u201d and although the measures taken by Portugal seem \u201csufficient to mitigate them,\u201d in his opinion, he considers that the government \u201cwas a little slow in the Lisbon region,\u201d adding, \u201cwe still need some time to see the results.\u201d\nHe believes the government\u2019s reaction to put the population back into lockdown is important, but even more so is the capacity for testing that will detect those outbreaks. And here, Portugal can set an example. \u201cPortugal has always had an outstanding capacity for testing. It can give the impression that the country has lots more infections in comparison with other places, when that probably isn\u2019t the case,\u201d points out Cerqueira. It is worth noting that to date, Portugal has recorded more than 45,277 cases of coronavirus and 1,644 deaths, compared to 319,075 infections and over 44,000 deaths in the UK.\n\u201cTest, test, and test some more\u201d is one of the leitmotivs of Manuel Felices and the so-called Group of 22 scientists of which the Spanish surgeon is a part. This group, created in March by a group of internationally renowned researchers and doctors, has tried, \u201cfrom the strictly scientific point of view,\u201d to help change the Swedish strategy against the coronavirus.\nFelices considers that the \u201cactive tracing of possibly infected people\u201d is not sufficient in his host country, where he has lived and worked since 2012. Nevertheless, now the Group of 22\u2032s main bone of contention is face masks, which are still not recommended in Sweden, something these experts deem a mistake. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to get the use of face masks recommended, in hospitals and nursing homes of course, but also on the street if it\u2019s not possible to keep the social distance, on public transit, in restaurants, etc,\u201d Felices says.\nDespite Sweden\u2019s controversial stance and data that proves its strategy has failed to stem infections, Swedish citizens have mostly supported this strategy and, until very recently, it was difficult to hear criticism of the government\u2019s management. In mid-April, 73% of Swedes supported the country\u2019s health strategy , according to a survey by the independent agency Novus. However, for some time now, more and more people are suggesting that the government \u2013 even though it has not openly acknowledged this \u2013 has tried to follow a herd immunity strategy, allowing a high percentage of the population to get infected.\n\u201cFrom my point of view \u2013 and this is an opinion \u2013 the strategy has been based on allowing a rate of \u2018controlled\u2019 infection, thinking about herd immunity,\u201d Felices says. \u201cThe measures speak for themselves: They\u2019ve only recommended that over-70s stay at home, while schools, gyms, etc, have always stayed open,\u201d he explains. Nonetheless, antibody studies only show a prevalence rate between 5% and 7% among the Swedish population, similar to Spain and the rest of Europe, while the Swedish government \u201cwas hoping for around 40% in June,\u201d notes Felices. To achieve herd immunity, at least 60% of the population would have to be immunised.\nFinally, it seems that a bit of humility is also something important in this crisis, as the WHO indicated this week . \u201cThe sooner we assume there\u2019s a problem, the better. The sooner we contain the virus, the less the economy and the country\u2019s image abroad will suffer,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o J\u00falio Cerqueira. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not only a question of the virus, but of the image the country conveys to the world. Some countries, like Norway and the UK, have excluded Portugal from the reopening of their borders for this reason. It\u2019s happened in Portugal, but it might also happen in Spain,\u201d he says.\nIn the meantime, Spain and Portugal reopened their border last Wednesday in a formal ceremony that ended three and a half months of isolation between the Iberian countries. Sweden cannot say the same at the moment: Norway, Denmark, and Finland are still not accepting travellers from their Scandinavian neighbour.\nThis article first appeared on HuffPost Spain"}, {"RECORDID": "20200426-20673", "label": -1, "title": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump isn't a king but claims expansive power", "body": "Stay in the know at a glance with the Top 10 daily stories\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Over the past week, President Donald Trump was pretender to a throne that doesn't exist as he claimed king-like powers over the coronavirus pandemic response and Congress.\nHe also denied praising China's openness in the pandemic, when he's on record doing so repeatedly, and claimed far more Chinese than Americans are dying from COVID-19 when the numbers show the opposite.\nA look at his recent rhetoric and its relationship with reality.\nCHINA vs. US\nTRUMP: \u201cChina has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!\u201d \u2014 tweet Friday.\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s the reverse, more than 4,600 recorded deaths in China compared with more than 36,000 in the United States. And the notion that China can overtake the U.S. in a final accounting of the dead is a long shot right now.\nEven with the upward revision Friday of Chinese deaths \u2014 which was not a doubling, as Trump claimed \u2014 the recorded U.S. death toll is about seven times higher than China\u2019s, according to the count by Johns Hopkins University as of Friday night. And China has more than four times more people.\nThe full picture is not known in either country. Trump routinely manipulates information to make the U.S response to the coronavirus pandemic look better than it is. China\u2019s secretive leadership obscured the severity of the crisis for crucial weeks, and its numbers remain in question.\nAs well, deaths from the virus have not been fully reported in either country because the pandemic is still raging in the U.S. and still being accounted for in China.\nBut for China to surpass the U.S. in this count, it would have to be underreporting deaths by the tens of thousands, and deaths in the U.S. would have to nosedive from the current trend and projections.\n___\nEXECUTIVE AUTHORITY\nTRUMP: \u201cSome in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect ... It is the decision of the President.\u201d \u2014 tweets Monday.\nTRUMP, asked about his level of authority to reopen the country: \u201cI have the ultimate authority.... They can\u2019t do anything without the approval of the president of the United States.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Monday.\nTHE FACTS: The federal government did not close down the country and won\u2019t be reopening it. Restrictions on public gatherings, workplaces, mobility, store operations, schools and more were ordered by states and communities, not Washington. The federal government has imposed border controls; otherwise its social distancing actions are mostly recommendations, not mandates.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, knocking down a series of false rumors about the coronavirus, makes clear that \u201cstates and cities are responsible for announcing curfews, shelters in place, or other restrictions and safety measures.\u201d\nTrump has argued that states and communities imposed restrictions because he let them and that he can overrule their decisions. Constitutional experts disagree.\n\u201cThe president can un-declare his national emergency declarations, which freed up federal funds and provided assistance to state and local governments,\u201d said Walter Dellinger, a former acting U.S. solicitor general. \u201cBut he has no federal statutory or constitutional power to override steps taken by governors and mayors under state law. He has never understood that he lacks a general power to rule by decree.\u201d\nThe federal government does have broad constitutional authority over states on things that cross state lines and involve the entire nation, such as regulating interstate commerce and immigration, levying taxes or declaring war. What Trump is proposing, however, is different. He is wading into states\u2019 sharply defined powers to protect public health.\nAsked what authority he had to make such an assertion of presidential power, Trump promised earlier in the week that he would provide a legal memorandum supporting his view. By Thursday, he hadn't and he told governors that day they could reopen states when they deem appropriate.\n___\nTRUMP: \u201cIf the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Wednesday.\nTHE FACTS: His power to adjourn Congress is highly questionable.\nThe Constitution does not spell out a unilateral power for the president to adjourn Congress. It states only that he can decide on adjournment if there is a dispute over that matter between the House and Senate. Such a disagreement does not exist, nor is it likely to arise.\nConstitutional scholar Jonathan Turley said on Twitter the Constitution gives a president authority in \u201cextraordinary occasions\u201d to convene or adjourn Congress. But, he said, \u201cThis power has never been used and should not be used now.\u201d\nTrump is unhappy that Congress has refused to fully adjourn during most breaks. Because Congress is still formally in session, Trump can't circumvent Congress and unilaterally put his nominees for various positions to work in the jobs he wants them to have. Lawmakers also used the tactic of holding off on adjournment to thwart some of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees.\nDoug Andres, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said McConnell will find ways to confirm nominees essential to the pandemic response but Senate rules will require that the Democratic leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, give consent to move forward on them.\n___\nWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nTRUMP, explaining in part why he is freezing money to the World Health Organization: \u201cThe WHO willingly took China\u2019s assurances to face value, and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising China for its so-called transparency. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Tuesday.\nTRUMP, asked about his past praise of China: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about China\u2019s transparency.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Tuesday.\nTHE FACTS: He did praise China's transparency as well as its overall performance in the pandemic.\nWhile it's true that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus complimented China's response, Trump early on similarly took China's assurances at face value.\nIn a CNBC interview on Jan. 22, Trump was asked if he trusted information from China about the coronavirus. \"I do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have a great relationship with President Xi.\u201d\nTwo days later, he was even more effusive. \u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,\u201d he tweeted. \"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. ...I want to thank President Xi!\"\nTrump kept up the compliments when asked several times in February about whether data from China can be trusted,. He called Xi \u201cextremely capable\u201d and said he's \u201cdoing a very good job with a very, very tough situation.\u201d\nSuch praise faded as the pandemic hit hard in the U.S. and the federal response stumbled. The time was ripe for scapegoats. It also become clearer that China had not been forthcoming at the start.\nOn March 21, Trump said of his earlier remarks: \u201cChina was transparent at that time, but when we saw what happened, they could have been transparent much earlier than they were.\" In any event, his denial that he ever praised China's openness is false.\n___\nTRADE\nTRUMP: \u201cChina has paid us nothing in your last administration, nothing in any previous administration. They paid us tens of billions of dollars because of what we\u2019ve done. And the trade deal we have, they have to give us $250 billion in purchases. ...We\u2019re taking in billions of dollars for China \u2014 from China. They never paid us 10 cents.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Tuesday.\nTHE FACTS: A familiar assertion, false to the core.\nIt\u2019s false to say the U.S. never collected a dime in tariffs on Chinese goods before he took action. They are simply higher in some cases than they were before. It\u2019s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by China. Tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from U.S. businesses and consumers, not from China. Tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically.\n___\nTRUMP, on the World Trade Organization: \u201cWe\u2019re winning a lot of lawsuits right now that we never won before in the past. We\u2019re winning a lot of money that we never won in the past. That\u2019s with the World Trade.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Wednesday.\nTHE FACTS: He is wildly wrong to suggest that the U.S. was bound to lose disputes taken to the trade organization before him.\nThe U.S. has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the WTO. In 2017, trade analyst Daniel Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute found that the U.S. won 91% of the cases it took to the Geneva-based trade monitor.\nAs Ikenson noted, countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don\u2019t bother going to the WTO in the first place if they don\u2019t have a strong case.\n___\nDRUG TREATMENTS\nTRUMP, on the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine: \"We have millions of doses that we bought, and many people are using it all over the country. And just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that \u2014 that drug. So, who knows? ...It\u2019s a lot of good things that are happening with it.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Monday.\nTHE FACTS: He continues to make unverified claims about a drug that can have serious side effects and may not work. The drug has not been proven as a treatment for COVID-19, and Trump\u2019s own health experts say more studies are needed to know whether it\u2019s safe and effective to use.\nThe president has been talking up hydroxychloroquine, a drug long used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, after very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner.\nDoctors can already prescribe the malaria drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing. The Food and Drug Administration has allowed the drugs into the national stockpile, but only for narrowly defined purposes as studies continue on whether they are effective and safe enough to be approved for wider use by people sick with the coronavirus.\nThe drug has major potential side effects, especially for the heart, and large studies are underway. The FDA says people should not take it without a prescription and emphasizes that the malaria drugs being explored \u201care not FDA-approved for treatment of COVID-19.\u201d\nThe American Medical Association, the American Pharmacists Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists in a joint statement warned against \u201cprophylactically prescribing medications currently identified as potential treatments for COVID-19.\u201d That means prescribing a medicine for the purpose of warding off a disease or preventing its spread.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday barred pilots from taking hydroxychloroquine and closely related chloroquine within 48 hours of flying. The safety agency cites the \u201cwide variety of dosages\u201d and lack of standards around using the drugs to treat the coronavirus in deciding that any pilots who take them must wait before flying.\n___\nTRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\nTRUMP, on imposing restrictions on travel from China: \u201cI saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives, by doing that.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Monday.\nTRUMP: \u201cAnd if we didn\u2019t close our border early \u2014 very early, long before the kind of dates you\u2019re talking about \u2014 we would have had thousands and probably hundreds of thousands more death.\u201d \u2014 news briefing Tuesday.\nTHE FACTS: Trump has no standing to boast about saving thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of lives because he imposed travel restrictions on China when he did. The impact hasn\u2019t been quantified.\nWhile Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health has praised the travel restrictions on China for slowing the virus, public health officials don't know the effect of them. The move left plenty of gaps in containment.\nTrump\u2019s order in late January did not fully \u201cclose\u201d the U.S. off to China, as he asserts. It temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in China within the previous 14 days, with exceptions for the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents.\nAmericans returning from China were allowed back after enhanced screening at select ports of entry and for 14 days afterward. But screenings can miss people who don\u2019t yet show symptoms of COVID-19. While symptoms often appear within five days or six days of exposure, the incubation period is 14 days.\nA recent study from the journal Science found China\u2019s internal crackdown modestly delayed the spread of the virus. It cast doubt that travel restrictions elsewhere will do much compared with other preventive measures, citing in part the likelihood that a large number of people exposed to the virus had already been traveling internationally without being detected.\nFor weeks after the first U.S. case of the coronavirus was confirmed in January, government missteps caused a shortage of reliable laboratory tests, leading to delays in diagnoses.\n___\nEDITOR'S NOTE \u2014 A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck"}, {"RECORDID": "20200125-20160", "label": 0, "title": "China's Hubei to ensure medium-to-long term materials reserves - local paper | Reuters", "body": "By Reuters Staff\n1 Min Read\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s central province Hubei, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, will ensure supplies of emergency materials and medium-to-long term reserves, the government-backed newspaper reported on Saturday, citing a provincial party leader.\nThe move comes amid the outbreak of the new coronavirus which has killed 41 and infected more than 1,300 globally.\nThe province plans to build two designated hospitals with a combined 2,300 beds, to treat coronavirus patients.\nReporting by Muyu Xu, Judy Hua and Tony Munroe; editing by David Evans\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200324-30490", "label": 1, "title": "European shares mark best day since 2008 on hopes of calmer markets | Reuters", "body": "By Ambar Warrick , Sagarika Jaisinghani\n3 Min Read\n(Reuters) - European shares surged on Tuesday, recovering a week\u2019s worth of losses as the prospect of some stability from recent stimulus measures saw buying into markets wallowing around seven-year lows.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX jumped 8.4% in its strongest session since late-2008.

But as long as that's the case, Dr. Aaron Milstone, a professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University, said schools should require it the same way other vaccines are mandated, including exemptions for certain groups.\nAll 50 states grant exceptions from the mandate for those that cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons and 45 allow exemptions for religious reasons, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nAlong with helping to prevent deaths, Milstone said vaccinating large numbers of children prevents \"absenteeism\" because it keeps people from being out of work, out of school and just generally feeling unwell.\nVideo: Flu shot and COVID-19: Health officials urge those eligible to get flu vaccine, avoid 'twindemic' (ABC 7 Chicago)\nNASA begins assembling Artemis space launch system\nPresident Trump takes questions from reporters for first time since Election Day\nComing Up on 'Fox News Sunday': November 29\nMaria Bartiromo to interview Trump on Sunday, his first since Election Day\nAstronaut shows Earth from SpaceX Crew Dragon\nMilitary police commander surprises children\nExperts unpack situation in Iran escalating as Biden takes office\nOn the site of the army barracks where Ethiopia's conflict began\nIran vows revenge after top nuclear scientist killed\nTrump era shows \u2018Constitution stronger than one man\u2019 expert says\nUK police arrest 60 in anti-lockdown protests\nIf Biden didn't win, how is GA runoff a check on Dem White House?\nRep.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a vaccine in September of that year and the first doses were administered in October.\nBy late December, the vaccine was available to anyone who wanted it and although it wasn't required, clinics were set up in schools to vaccinate students on a voluntary basis.\nMichelle Kelly, an associate professor of nursing at Villanova University, called the measure \"absolutely essential\" if a new coronavirus vaccine becomes available. Without assuring access to the vaccination, the messaging about the need to be inoculated won't matter, Kelly said.\nPart of the messaging has to focus on the direct risk to each child, according to Milstone. While attempts to convince people to follow social distancing guidelines and practice proper hand hygiene has been geared toward protecting the vulnerable, Milstone said asking people to protect their community isn't always as \"powerful\" as asking them to protect themselves.\n\"It's not just, 'Hey be a good citizen and help your community, get your kid vaccinated!' They also need to understand kids can die of this,\" Milstone said. \"Once there's a vaccine that becomes a vaccine-preventable death and that's a lot of burden to live with if you don't vaccinate your kid.\"\nMultiple polls indicated roughly one-third of American adults won't get a coronavirus vaccine if it becomes available. To convey the need to get vaccinated is something that requires public health officials, church and community leaders, school officials, health care providers, advocacy groups and social media influencers, on target, Kelly said.\n\"The health care community in the U.S. has not always done a good job of spreading one message through many voices,\" Kelly said. \" We must do so now.\"\nAs a matter of practicality, Schaffner pointed to the CDC statistic that about four million children are born each year in the U.S., meaning a significant number of doses will need to be procured to require students to be vaccinated.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a Healthline town hall that he doesn't foresee a mandate being put in place for the general public with regard to a coronavirus vaccine. Given that any vaccine is months away, Schaffner said a measure that can be taken now is requiring immunizations for the flu.\nMassachusetts has already implemented such a mandate. The state's department of health announced August 19 that all students under the age of 30 must have a flu vaccine by December 31, unless a religious or medical exemption is given.\nLowering the number of flu cases helps prevent health care systems from being overrun with patients. Plus, the flu and new coronavirus have similar clinical symptoms, so Schaffner said those who are vaccinated for the flu are less likely to dismiss new coronavirus symptoms as being the flu, thereby decreasing chances they delay getting tested and spread the virus further.\nIf a new coronavirus vaccine proves to be safe and effective for children, deciding whether to implement a mandate comes down to \"how easy would it be to do this and how much juice do we get for the squeeze,\" Schaffner said.\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial"}, {"RECORDID": "20200417-72606", "label": -1, "title": "I-TEAM: Lack of transparency from the state as families learn about COVID-19 in facilities", "body": "Friday, April 17, 2020\nNews 12 at 6 o'clock/NBC at 7\nAUGUSTA, GA.

However, the state of South Carolina has not been as forthright with sharing information about COVID-19 in nursing homes.\nTwo nursing homes in Aiken confirm COVID-19 in their facilities. A patient tested positive at Anchor Health and Rehab. News 12 was told that the person is isolated and the situation is contained. A part-time worker tested positive Pepper Hill Rehab and Nursing.\nOur I-TEAM found the state\u2019s lack of transparency could be putting many at risk.\nGeorgia began releasing the names of nursing homes with cases of COVID-19 a few weeks ago. South Carolina, on the other hand, is one of the few states left that will not release that information. Families cannot visit their loved ones themselves right now so they\u2019re solely reliant on what facilities will or will not tell them.\nAnchor Health and Rehab sent a letter to patients\u2019 families this week stating that a resident has the virus. And families of loved ones at Pepper Hill Rehab and Nursing got a call that a part-time employee tested positive.\nThe two Aiken nursing homes are keeping families and the public updated, but not all nursing homes are as transparent.\n\u201cWe have families out there who are scared, anxious, frustrated, confused by the lack of transparency in trying to get information into what is going on in grandma\u2019s nursing home,\" Brian Lee said.\nLee is the director of Families for Better Care - a nationwide non-profit advocacy group for seniors in nursing homes.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen states argue there could be HIPPA laws here that they cannot release or discuss information but that\u2019s not the case,\" Lee said.\nSouth Carolina is one of those states. South Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control sent an email to the I-TEAM after we asked for the names of nursing homes with positive cases of COVID-19. DHEC refused to cite privacy concerns.\n\u201cHIPAA laws don\u2019t really apply with providing aggregated information by name of the facility where outbreaks are occurring,\" Lee said.\nThe I-TEAM also found most states-including Georgia- believe HIPAA was designed to protect the patient, not the company. Even some companies agree. Pruitt Health - who has locations in South Carolina - is posting COVID-19 numbers at each location on its website. The public will find more here than on DHEC\u2019s website.\n\u201cWhy, why is it that these states are so bent to shrouding this information keeping it a mystery to all of us?\" Lee said.\nFamilies tell me they can only hope their loved one is in a nursing home who is keeping them informed.\nThe owner of Pepper Hill wants DHEC to release the names of all South Carolina nursing homes with positive COVID-19 patients. She told News 12 the part-time employee who tested positive at her facility also worked at another facility. She says there are cases of the virus at that facility but she was not made aware until the employee tested positive. So an example where sharing information could help.\nCopyright 2020 WRDW/WAGT.

Some lawmakers say it's unlikely that more financial relief would reach Americans before November.\nIf Republicans and Democrats do agree to new aid in the future, unemployed people who take the federal benefit could be seen as double-dipping: They would receive retroactive pay from the new legislation even though they already been paid through Trump\u2019s executive action.\n\u201cAll of this confusion just makes for more administrative burdens at a time when people are going longer without benefits, living standards are declining and poverty is rising after millions lost their jobs through no fault of their own from the pandemic,\u201d says Heidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\nMore pay cuts: More workers hit with pay cuts than in last recession, and stagnant wages could linger\n'We shouldn't have to beg': Americans struggle without unemployment aid as Congress stalls on extending benefits\nA spokesman from the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development said the state is following guidance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is funding Trump's Lost Wages Assistance program, and the Department of Labor. FEMA, however, said that states administer the program while the agency provides the funds.\nIt's still unclear how widespread this is beyond Wisconsin. Colorado, Indiana, Georgia, Iowa, Alabama, Idaho, Arizona, Arkansas, Hawaii, Alaska and Nebraska said they aren't advising recipients to return the money.\nThe Louisiana Workforce Commission said it will monitor legislation from Congress, and added that it would ensure that any future guidelines are met as provided from the Department of Labor.\nThe $300 weekly benefit is retroactive to Aug. 1 for workers who qualify. Wisconsin's DWD doesn't anticipate that it will be forced to claw back the aid from claimants, although its own website posted the warning to out-of-work residents who tried to file unemployment claims.\nIt remains unclear whether future aid from Congress will be made retroactive to Aug. 1, meaning the payments would overlap, a spokesman said.\nThe DWD is anticipating that if Congress passes new legislation, it will begin once Trump's Lost Wages Assistance program lapses for the week ended Sept. 5 so that there would be no overlap, they added.\nStill, a potential overpayment issue threatens to create problems in other states beyond Wisconsin if Congress allows retroactive payments to overlap, experts say. States could face a reckoning over how to recover the money if people were overpaid, they warned.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a high chance that Congress could backdate a new relief program, creating problems for states that already distributed money from the Lost Wages Assistance program,\" says Andrew Stettner, an unemployment expert and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a think tank.\n\"If Congress doesn\u2019t address this in a new relief package, there would be an overpayment situation for many jobless Americans across the country that would need to be resolved,\" he added.\nA house divided: As millions face evictions, others buy dream homes amid COVID-19\nMichele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project, was concerned that something like this could happen as states rushed to get Trump's Lost Wages Assistance program up and running when it was enacted in August. The program replaces the $600 federal unemployment supplement that expired in late July.\n\"This would be nightmarish for jobless Americans and state unemployment systems alike if people are forced to return the money,\" says Evermore. \"Wisconsin isn\u2019t necessarily in the wrong for sharing a disclaimer. It\u2019s worth letting people know that this temporary benefit is uncertain.\u201d\nIn August, Trump called for a $300-per-week federally-funded jobless benefit for workers who were unemployed due to the pandemic after coronavirus aid talks stalled in Congress.\nTrump directed FEMA to run the $300-per-week relief program through its Disaster Relief Fund, which would be capped at $44 billion. It was supposed to last until December. But experts estimate that states will exhaust the funds after about five or six weeks from early August, threatening to leave out-of-work Americans without the additional aid within a matter of weeks after Congress failed to pass another aid package this month.\nAnd some states including Arizona, Missouri and Montana have already exhausted the funds. And Texas said Wednesday that the disbursement of the extra $300 would expire for the week ended Sept. 5.\nThe latest failed attempt to strike a deal in Washington may have been the last opportunity for lawmakers to reach an accord on a stimulus bill before the election in November. Some economists say that the lapse in aid could spell trouble for household spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic growth.\nNearly 30 million Americans are receiving unemployment benefits, according to the Labor Department. State unemployment programs cover only about 41% of someone\u2019s lost wages, data from the Brookings Institution shows.\n\u201cSome people can\u2019t cover their basic needs on regular state benefits. It\u2019s only going to get harder until the economy recovers,\" says Stettner. \"People may be forced to make more drastic decisions by either raiding their 401(k)s or selling their homes, creating a bigger inequality divide in America.\u201d\nNearly all states except for South Dakota have applied for funds through FEMA. So far, at least 25 of them have begun disbursing the money.\nStates can\u2019t normally pay unemployment insurance that isn't authorized by Congress. So they have been forced to reconfigure their systems to distribute the funds, resulting in long delays.\nWisconsin, a key swing state in the U.S. election, was approved to provide an additional $300 a week in federal aid for three weeks to those receiving unemployment due to lost wages from the pandemic. And additional weeks of funding will be determined on a weekly basis afterward.\nBut the state warned earlier this month that it could take eight weeks to reprogram the state's unemployment system to disburse the funds.\nGuidance from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that the Lost Wages Assistance program from the Trump administration must end if Congress passes new legislation providing supplementary unemployment benefits, including extending the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program that expired in July.\nStill, the question of whether people must return the money provided by Trump's program can't be answered until new legislation provides guidance, according to the Department of Labor.\nEssentially, the federal government is saying it has yet to determine how possible overpayments through the program will be repaid. That has left the door open for states like Wisconsin to interpret how to recoup the money, according to Victor Forberger, a Wisconsin-based labor and employment attorney who specializes in unemployment cases.\n\u201cWisconsin has made an administrative interpretation as opposed to what the law allows,\u201d argues Forberger, who added that the state is \u201cvery aggressive\u201d when it comes to recouping overpayments.\nTo be sure, it\u2019s possible that Wisconsin could be overstepping its authority, some experts argue, since there\u2019s nothing in the current declaration that would allow states to require people to pay back the Loss Wages Assistance.\nThe Department of Labor directed USA TODAY to contact FEMA for comment.\n\u201cFEMA provides the funding, the states administer the program,\u201d FEMA told USA TODAY in an emailed statement. \u201cFEMA cannot estimate if people will be eligible or ineligible to receive Lost Wages Assistance. Eligibility determinations are made at the state level.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how people would pay back the money, but there are a couple of ways it could happen.\nIf Congress passes a new enhanced unemployment program, people could have their retroactive federal payments reduced to cover overpayments, says Shierholz. Or they could get paid in full under the new program but have to pay back what they owe, she added.\nContributing: Brent Schrotenboer and Charisse Jones\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Unemployment: Wisconsin asks residents to return $300 jobless aid"}, {"RECORDID": "20200126-20875", "label": -1, "title": "Tracking the Virus Outbreak\u2019s Impact on Business and Travel", "body": "As the death toll from the pneumonia-like illness rises and\u00a0cases are found in neighboring Asian countries, including South Korea and Singapore, as well as\u00a0in the U.S., the economic impact of the novel coronavirous could be widespread.\nHere is a rundown of what big companies are saying so far about the impact.\nHonda Motor Co.\nThe automaker will evacuate from Wuhan about 30 Japanese staff, family members and employees visiting on business trips, Teruhiko Tatebe, a Tokyo-based spokesman, said by phone.

But on June 20, the average age was 38.\nThe shift in Missouri follows a trend public health officials are seeing across the country as states push to re-open their economies and see people again crowding beaches, bars and restaurants.\nAnd the hospital association paper pointed out that it made sense: Missourians under age 45 make up a majority of the population and are the group most likely to be exposed going back to work or social events.\nIt also pointed out that the younger cohort is generally more likely to survive infection, explaining the good news of how hospitalizations and deaths have declined since Memorial Day even as cases have risen.\nBut the paper also had bad news: younger people are also more likely to be sick without symptoms, making them more likely to unwittingly spread the virus with friends and family members at greater risk of getting very sick and dying.\n\u201cThis gets to the essence of this disease and why it\u2019s so hard to control,\u201d said Dave Dillon, a spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Association. \u201cYou can be walking around with this disease, not know it, and still do a lot of damage.

What does it mean? | Reuters", "body": "By Karen Brettell\n4 Min Read\nMarch 3 (Reuters) - The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury fell below 1% for the first time, as investors rush towards low-risk investments and worry about the economic impact of the spreading coronavirus.\nThe Federal Reserve earlier made its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis. It cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 1%, the lowest since June 2017.\nThis is what lower Treasury yields mean:\nTreasury yields are falling as investors anticipate a weak global economic growth outlook, which has been worsened by the coronavirus. Lower yields also reflect benign inflation as the Federal Reserve struggles to achieve its target of 2% price increases.\nChina is a significant contributor to global growth. When it closed factories it slowed its economy, and in some cases left international firms struggling for parts. A similar response in other countries would be an additional drag on growth.\nMany sectors including travel, retail and hospitality are likely to see slowdowns as people respond to the virus by spending less time in crowded areas.\nYields have tumbled as investors pile into the safe-haven bonds to protect against losses in riskier asset such as stocks and corporate bonds. The move down in yields has also prompted investors to hedge mortgage holdings, which adds to the decline.\nStill, U.S. Treasuries remain relatively attractive as they pay higher yields than comparable bonds in Europe and Japan, many of which trade in negative territory. U.S. 10-year Treasuries currently yield 0.95%, compared to negative 0.64% in Germany and negative 0.11% in Japan.\nFalling yields put pressure on the Federal Reserve to respond. The U.S. central bank on Tuesday cut interest rates in an emergency move meant to loosen financial conditions and protect the economy from the impact of the coronavirus.\nTight economic conditions make businesses less likely to invest in growing their firms, which harms economic growth. Looser economic conditions can stimulate growth by encouraging firms to borrow and spend.\nBy cutting rates the Federal Reserve also signals that it is willing to act to maintain the economic expansion, which gives give companies more confidence to invest and hire.\nInterest rate futures traders pricing in a 58% probability of a further 25 basis point cut in April, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool.\nThe biggest beneficiary of lower rates is the U.S. government, which has been financing its growing deficits with public debt.\nThe non-partisan Congressional Budget Office expects U.S. federal debt held by the public to grow to $31.4 trillion by 2030, from $17.9 trillion this year. The higher the rate paid on the debt, the more pressure it puts on government spending and the more it weighs on gross domestic product.\nCompanies also benefit as they can borrow more cheaply and invest in growing their business, which boosts growth and employment. This investment, and greater liquidity from looser monetary conditions, typically boosts stock prices.\nLower interest rates feed through to cheaper mortgages, which can lure new home buyers. They also allow existing home owners to refinance loans at lower rates, which reduces their debt obligation. Consumers can borrow at cheaper rates to finance auto purchases or other large purchases.\nSavers, primarily. As returns from savings accounts fall, pensioners and others that rely on a fixed income may be pushed to invest in riskier assets such as stocks or corporate bonds to make ends meet. This puts them at greater risk of investment losses.\nPeople trying to enter the home market can benefit from lower rates, but also suffer from higher home prices that result from cheaper loans. This requires them to save more for a deposit. They are also more exposed to losses if rates change direction and move higher, which typically leads house prices to fall.\nLower rates also give the Federal Reserve less ammunition to fight a recession down the road if it emerges.\nReporting by Karen Brettell; editing by Megan Davies and Lisa Shumaker\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200218-56", "label": 0, "title": "WHO urges calm as China virus death toll reaches 2,000", "body": "The death toll from the new coronavirus outbreak surged to 2,000 on Wednesday, as Chinese and international health officials warned against excessive measures to contain the epidemic. More than 74,000 people have now been infected by the virus in China, with hundreds more cases in some 25 countries. The situation remains serious at the epicentre, with the director of a hospital in the central city of Wuhan becoming the seventh medical worker to succumb to the COVID-19 illness. But Chinese officials released a study showing most patients have mild cases of the infection, and World Health Organization officials said the mortality rate was relatively low. The outbreak is threatening to put a dent in the global economy, with China paralysed by vast quarantine measures and major firms such as iPhone maker Apple and mining giant BHP warning it could damage bottom lines. Several countries have banned travellers from China and major airlines have suspended flights -- something that Beijing's ambassador to the EU warned was fuelling panic and threatening attempts to resume business. Russia on Tuesday said no Chinese citizens would be allowed to enter its territory from February 20. The epidemic has triggered panic-buying in Singapore and Hong Kong, concerns about cruise-ship travel and the postponement of trade fairs, sports competitions and cultural events in China and abroad. Authorities have placed about 56 million people in hard-hit central Hubei and its capital Wuhan under an unprecedented lockdown. The city was carrying out \"very good public health practice\" with door-to-door surveillance, said Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme. Other cities far from the epicentre have restricted the movement of residents, with a 14-day self-quarantine for people returning to Beijing. President Xi Jinping, in a phone call with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said China's measures were achieving \"visible progress\", according to state media. - 'Less deadly' than SARS - The official death toll in China hit 2,000 after another 132 people died in Hubei, where the virus emerged in December. Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, became its latest victim, sparking an outpouring of grief online. Earlier this month, the death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang -- who had been punished by authorities for sounding the alarm about the virus in late December -- triggered anger and calls on social media for political reform. Official figures, meanwhile, showed there were nearly 1,700 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday in Hubei. New infections have been falling in the rest of the country for the past two weeks. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that it was too early to tell if the decline would continue. A study among tens of thousands of confirmed and suspected cases showed that 81 percent of patients had only mild infections. The study released by China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also showed the death rate stood at 2.3 percent, falling below one percent for people in their 30s and 40s. WHO officials said the COVID-19 illness was \"less deadly\" than its cousins, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). But it is higher than the mortality rate for the seasonal flu, at around 0.1 percent in the United States. Ryan said the outbreak was \"very serious\" and could grow, but stressed that outside Hubei the epidemic was \"affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people\". There have been some 900 cases around the world, with five deaths in France, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Another 88 people tested positive for the virus on the quarantined Diamond Prince cruise ship off Yokohama in Japan, raising the number of those infections to 542. The US has repatriated more than 300 American passengers and Britain became the latest country to offer its citizens a way off the ship after similar plans by Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and South Korea. And around 500 passengers were to leave the vessel on Wednesday after testing negative for the virus. burs-lth-rox/jah"}, {"RECORDID": "20200318-2859", "label": -1, "title": "Trump says he will invoke wartime act to fight 'enemy' coronavirus | Reuters", "body": "By Jeff Mason , Steve Holland\n4 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump moved on Wednesday to accelerate production of desperately needed medical equipment to battle the coronavirus pandemic and said an estimate that U.S. unemployment could conceivably reach 20 percent was a worst case scenario.\nScrambling to address the virus after initially playing it down, Trump said he is invoking the Defense Production Act, putting in place a law that will allow the U.S. government to speed production of masks, respirators, ventilators and other needed equipment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to defeat the invisible enemy,\u201d said Trump, who said the unfolding crisis had basically made him a \u201cwar-time president.\u201d\nTrump said he would invoke another law that would allow U.S. authorities to turn back migrants seeking to cross the southern border of the United States illegally.

We are trying to address this.\u201d\nIt it not yet clear what will happen to the weekly border protests that came to redefine the modern era of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nBut the incompatibility of crowded protests with new health realities is not lost on march organisers. \u201cThere is a debate and it is more likely large gatherings that had been planned will be cancelled,\u201d one senior organiser told Reuters.\nGaza medical officials say 215 Palestinians were killed in the two years of border protests, with another 8,000 suffering gunshot wounds, 88 percent of them to the limbs.\nDuring that period one Israeli soldier was killed on the border during the demonstrations, by a sniper.\nIn 2019 U.N. Human Rights Council investigators said Israeli forces may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, with children and paramedics among the fatalities.\nIsrael defended its response, describing the protests as riots and saying it faced attacks by militants instigated and organised by the Islamist militant movement Hamas that rules Gaza.\nLast week Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said soldiers remained vigilant against attempts to breach the fence. \u201cWe continue to assess the situation and continue to monitor what Hamas and other terrorist organisations in Gaza are doing,\u201d he said.\nThe stated aims of the protests were an end to the Israeli-led blockade on Gaza and for its refugees to have the right to return to lands in Israel where their ancestors once lived.\nIsrael refuses any such right of return, fearing it would lose its Jewish majority. It cites security for the blockade, after the takeover of Gaza in 2007 by Hamas, which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States.\nIn Gaza the scars of the protests are everywhere, and remain a source of controversy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they achieved anything,\u201d said Mohannad Al-Aswad, 30, who says he lost his right leg after being struck by an Israeli bullet in 2018.

Now this NC nurse is helping coronavirus patients.", "body": "RALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 For the past few years, Lacie Maninga has been known as the \u201cDuchess of Pain.\u201d\nStrange name for a nurse, yes?\nBut that\u2019s what they called Maninga in the Fayetteville Roller Derby, where Maninga was a blocker and jammer for the Ritzy Rollers. It was her way to get away from the hospital, have some fun and compete and she was good at it. She also met her husband, John, through roller derby, so there was that.\nBut with a family of five kids, Maninga decided her playing days in flat track roller derby should end and became an official last fall. That, too, has changed with so much on hold.\nManinga is nursing manager of the Emergency Department and ICU at Central Harnett Hospital in Lillington. Much of her days is filled with dealing with the coronavirus, with trying to keep the virus contained and its damage minimal to the patients stricken with it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a pandemic and it has been scary at times,\u201d Maninga said in an interview with The News & Observer. \u201cIn the beginning we did not know what we were dealing with or what to expect. The numbers have gone down and we\u2019re in an OK position right now at the hospital, but \u2026 \u201c\nNorth Carolina\u2019s stay-at-home restrictions will be in place at least until May 8 but there will eventually be a gradual loosening of those restrictions as the state looks to jumpstart the economy. There also will be more testing. How will that affect the number of positive cases, of potential patients?\n\u201cCan we handle it? What if we suddenly had a surge of 50 positive tests? It could get scary again,\u201d Maninga said.\nFace mask hides her smile from patients\nManinga has had COVID-19 patients. For a nurse, for any healthcare professional, it can be an emotional time.\n\u201cI\u2019m a touchy-feely person who likes to sit on the patient\u2019s bed, cuddle up with them and give them a hug,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s very difficult for people like me who are sentimental about those things is that I have on a face mask. They can\u2019t see our expressions. They can\u2019t see the little smiles we try to give them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult.\u201d\nManinga said the last sentence after taking a deep breath, her tone of voice tinged with the emotion of knowing, of seeing, of coping. Thursday was her 35th birthday and likely one the Kentucky native won\u2019t forget given all that has happened in the last few months.\n\u201cLacie is always thinking about other people,\u201d said Marleigh Zacek, chief nursing officer at Harnett Health System. \u201cShe was a staff nurse and has become a leader in the Emergency Department. She\u2019s like so many, working hard week to week without a day off, putting in 60 hours a week, putting her patients above herself.\u201d\nHer husband John Maninga is a U.S. Army sergeant first class whose 19 years of service have included tours in Iraq. He later was a combat-diver instructor while stationed in Key West, Fla., where Lacie was a practical nurse for Armor Correctional Health Services dealing with local inmates,. She also found time to start a roller derby league.\n\u201cShe has always put other people first, at work, home and derby,\u201d John Maninga said.\nLacie Maninga said she was weaned in a medical family. Her father was a nurse, as was her stepfather. A grandfather was a pharmacist.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I had any choice,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI grew up in a hospital and always knew that\u2019s where I belonged.\u201d\nManinga, born in Mayfield, Ky., attended West Kentucky Community and Technical College, then Bladen Community College, becoming a registered nurse. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree in nursing from American Sentinel University, and a master\u2019s degree from Capella University.\nExplaining the coronavirus to her kids\nThere is still much to learn about COVID-19, a novel coronavirus. There\u2019s much she wants to tell her children, whose ages range from 11 to 16, to try and help them understand why their lives have so dramatically changed.\nJohn Maninga handles a lot of the at-home schooling, she said. Lacie said he is dropping his Army retirement packet and plans to be a high school history teacher, saying, \u201cThis should be good preparation for him.\u201d\nLacie Maninga said she recently made the decision to avoid social media, frustrated that the coronavirus, in her opinion, has fostered too many political agendas. She believes the best course is to follow all the prescribed precautions: stay home as much as possible, social distancing, added testing.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s lives are at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to be political. This is the time to think which of your friends are you willing to let pass away because you didn\u2019t want to stay home. That\u2019s a reason the hospitals aren\u2019t being overrun.\u201d\nFrom roller derby to nurse\nAs a jammer in roller derby, Maninga\u2019s job was to pass opposing blockers, escape the pack, lap the pack and then score points for her team once she starts passing those blockers. It takes skill and grit.\n\u201cThe nature of the sport makes you a stronger person. It toughens you up,\u201d said Stephanie Waicus, a retired skater who handles the Fayetteville Roller Derby public relations. \u201cIt teaches you to keep pushing through exhaustion. You absolutely must push through your exhaustion because people depend on you. Your team depends on you.\n\u201cYou fight hard and smart or people get hurt. These are also areas where Duchess excels as a nurse.\u201d\nAdded Joe Rone, the league\u2019s staff photographer: \u201cHer efforts in fighting this hideous disease does not surprise any of us that have the good fortune of knowing her.\u201d\nManinga, like many in her profession, understands the coronavirus is expected to be like the flu in that it\u2019s seasonable. Like the flu, cases could surge again in the fall.\n\u201cMaybe by the fall we will have a vaccine,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s get a vaccine or perfect an effective treatment. We can do this.

This important economic indicator measures the USD against a basket of currencies, including the CAD, CHF, JPY, EUR, GBP, and SEK. As an important trade-weighted index, the DXY is the go-to economic indicator for assessing the relative strength or weakness of the US dollar.\nThe Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin stressed the importance of a stable USD as the world's reserve currency. To this end, a strong USD serves as an incentive for capital inflows, as indicated in the currency trading news of late. Demand for greenbacks invariably increases the value of the USD, as foreign currencies are sold (thereby decreasing their relative value), in favor of the dollar. The Treasury Secretary also alluded to various stimulus measures vis-a-vis a Republican-led coronavirus relief proposal.\nOne of the most important components of the U.S. Dollar Index is the EUR/USD currency pair, a major forex pair. The euro has marched inexorably higher against the greenback since May 2020, when it was trading around 1.080 \u2013 1.085. Today, the EUR/USD currency pair is trading in the 1.157 range. The 7.12% appreciation in the value of the EUR relative to the USD is notable. As an integral component of the DXY, the EUR comprises 57.6% of the index, accounting for a large chunk of the dollar's decline.\nExperts routinely weigh in on the fortunes of the USD, particularly when geopolitical crises are taking place. In the event that the dollar gets supplanted as the world's #1 reserve currency, a tidal wave of uncertainty will spread far and wide. Beginning in early 2020, the unemployment rate approached multi-decade lows at approximately 3.5%. Today, the unemployment rate numbers tens of millions of people, but that does not tell the full story. At the onset of the coronavirus, the House and the Senate worked quickly to provide a cushion in the form of a $600 per week unemployment benefit to people who lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus. That benefit expired at the end of July, and is said to be replaced by a more stringent benefit package estimated at 70% of the employees\u2019 wages.\nIn the months since the coronavirus outbreak, tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs temporarily, or permanently. The Federal Government stepped in with a series of massive stimulus measures to provide employers with funds to keep employees on the payroll . These multi-billion dollar relief packages have been exhausted, with up to 20 million Americans now staring down a barrel. Not since WW2 has the country experienced such an alarming unemployment rate. In the absence of these stimulus measures, a major eviction and foreclosure crisis is likely to ensue. Unfortunately, the computer systems that dispense the payments to millions of Americans are largely outdated, and this could result in lengthy delays before additional payments are made.\nAccording to the US Debt Clock, the US national debt is hovering around $26 trillion, with an average debt per citizen of $80,451, and a debt per taxpayer of over $213,000. The US Federal tax revenue is $2.379 trillion, amounting to $7,213 in revenue collected per citizen. In 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s balance sheet swelled from $4 trillion to over $7.2 trillion, as coronavirus relief packages flooded the economy. With plummeting savings, and increasing national debt, it stands to reason that the USD may struggle to retain its status as the ranking currency in the world. These views are shared by multiple economists, notable among them the former Morgan Stanley Asia chairman, Stephen Roach.\nMajor new developments are taking place in the currency markets, owing to increasing tensions between the US and China, and the UK and China. The US recently shuttered the Chinese Consulate in Houston, Texas. The People's Republic of China responded in kind by condemning the move and threatening reciprocal measures. However, the euro has posted strong gains in the currency markets, reaching a 1.5 year high of $1.1547 after unprecedented stimulus measures were revealed for the Eurozone. Nonetheless, the Chinese government tempered bullish prospects, resulting in a modest depreciation of the euro. Currency traders cashed in on the USDs fleeting bullishness by selling the USD/CNY pair. For now, all eyes will be on the immediate future, with a focus on the size, scope, and roll-out of the next stimulus package.\nThe myopic focus of the global economy is on day-to-day developments. Infection rates and morbidity numbers aside, countries are scrambling to fast-track a vaccine. Yet an equally important development is months away from unfolding \u2013 the US presidential elections. Never before has the contrast been quite as stark. Trump on the one hand is the quintessential capitalist \u2013 a low tax, high growth, deregulation-focused presidential contender. Joe Biden, the former VP is a high tax, modest growth, regulation-intensive focused presidential contender. Right vs Left. Clearly, the financial markets prefer Trump politics to Biden politics.\nIf President Trump wins re-election on November 8, stock markets will endure an unprecedented rally. If Joe Biden wins, markets can expect a tepid response. A Biden presidency will invariably result in much higher corporate taxation, much lower corporate profits, slower growth, and greater indebtedness at national level. China will be let off the hook, US companies will not have the protection of the federal government, and social welfare budgets will swell to unprecedented levels. The US dollar will take its cues from the election results. A Trump win is good for business, and that's good for the USD. Any other result could spur a socialist agenda with devastating repercussions for the USD , or maybe Biden will surprise us all\u2026."}, {"RECORDID": "20200929-58409", "label": -1, "title": "A third of American parents say they won't get their kids flu shots this year, despite the looming threat of flu season during COVID-19", "body": "LM Otero/AP\nA third of American parents don't plan to vaccinate their kids against the flu, according to a new poll from the National Poll on Children's Health .\nExperts have warned that this year's flu season and the coronavirus pandemic could overwhelm healthcare systems and spark a further public health crisis in the US.\nCenters for Disease Control Director Dr. Robert Redfield previously encouraged people to get their flu shots, warning in an interview with WebMD that this \"could be the worst fall from a public health perspective we've ever had.\"\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .\nOne in three Americans said they had no plans to vaccinate their kids against the flu, a new poll from the National Poll on Children's Health published on Monday.\nThe findings come as experts have advised adults and children alike to get their flu shot ahead of the fall and winter seasons that are expected to see cases of both the flu and COVID-19.\n\"We may see peaks of flu and COVID-19 at the same time, which could overwhelm the health care system, strain testing capacity and potentially reduce our ability to catch and treat both respiratory illnesses effectively,\" Sarah Clark, associate  director of the poll from C.S.

However, the inadequacy of e-government services in Japan has led to delays in the process of applying for subsidies and loans, creating confusion among those who made online applications to receive the benefit.\nAt the beginning of this century, the Japanese government proposed to build an \"e-government\", setting the goal of making all administrative procedures available online. But a recent report by the Japan Research Institute showed that only 7.5 percent of the more than 55,700 administrative procedures in Japan's central administrative departments could be completed online as of March 2019.\nPeople wearing face masks walk in a street in Ueno, Tokyo, Japan, May 30, 2020. (Xinhua/Du Xiaoyi)\nAtsuko Nomura, senior researcher at the Japan Research Institute in Tokyo, said that most administrative procedures in Japan at present still require to be handled in person, submit paper documents and be stamped.\nIn the Japanese government's efforts to deal with the outbreak, the country's My Number card system failed to function well, leading to a huge backlog of applications and sent crowds of people pouring into city halls to fix related problems, said Nomura.\nMy Number card system was put into operation in January 2016, which allocates each resident in Japan including foreigners a 12-digit number if they have their residency registered with authorities.

At least 69 cases this week were linked to a cluster of infections at a logistics facility operated by Coupang Corp, one of the country\u2019s largest online shopping firms, in Bucheon, west of Seoul.\nThe new cases took South Korea\u2019s tally to 11,344 with 269 deaths by midnight on Wednesday. A robust testing program this year was credited with keeping deaths comparatively low in a global pandemic that has now killed more than 350,000.\nUnlike many countries, South Korea did not impose a strict lockdown against the virus.\nBut the rise prompted health officials to call on Thursday for a return to tougher social distancing rules in major metropolitan areas, including closing some public places, such as museums, and getting employers to adopt flexible work plans.\n DEATHS IN EUROPE \nAbout 159,000 more people in 24 European countries have died since early March than would have ordinarily been expected, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thursday, with a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of the spike linked to COVID-19.\nSo far, more than 2 million people in Europe have been sickened by the new coronavirus, up 15% over the past two weeks, with Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Britain leading the way in new infections, WHO European officials said on a call.

Britain has the second highest death toll from the virus globally, with the confirmed tally rising by 412 to 37,460 on Wednesday.\n FRANCE \nThe number of coronavirus infections in France jumped on the same day the government announced an easing of lockdown rules, but the increase reflected the inclusion of new data rather than a rise in daily infections, the Health Ministry said.\nThe inclusion of data from a new tracking system boosted the number of confirmed coronavirus cases by 3,325 to 149,071, the biggest increase since a 4,183 increase on May 6, when data from a new laboratory were included.\n\u201cThe increase compared to yesterday is due to more efficient tracking, not to the epidemiological situation in France,\u201d the ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n U.S. DEATH TOLL SURPASSES 100,000 \n Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden released a video message on Wednesday marking the grim milestone of 100,000 American lives lost to the coronavirus pandemic , telling the bereaved: \u201cThe nation grieves with you.\u201d\nBiden spoke after various tallies of COVID-19 deaths, including one compiled by Reuters, showed that the novel coronavirus has killed over 100,000 people in the United States, even as the slowdown in deaths encouraged businesses to reopen and Americans to emerge from more than two months of lockdowns.\nThere are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief.

The coronavirus has killed more people than the AIDS epidemic did from 1981 through 1989.\n ETHIOPIA \nCases of community transmission of the new coronavirus are growing in Africa, particularly in Ethiopia, and a new strategy for testing is needed to prevent this, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday. Community transmission refers to cases where patients had no travel history or known contact with infected people \u2013 worrying for health workers because it means the virus is moving undetected through the population.\n\u201cWe are beginning to see sustained community transmission within Ethiopia and many other countries across Africa. That means we need to increase our public health measures like distancing, wearing of masks, washing of hands,\u201d John Nkengasong told journalists.\n BRAZIL \nBrazil\u2019s death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 25,000 people on Wednesday, at 25,598, the Health Ministry said.

In some cases, the cyber threat actors use software such as ransomware to extort money out of healthcare organizations such as medical clinics and hospitals.\n THE GREAT OUTDOORS \nMore than half of Canada\u2019s national parks \u2014 including Banff in Alberta, Pacific Rim in British Columbia and Cape Breton Highlands in Nova Scotia \u2014 are to reopen June 1. Minister of Environment Jonathan Wilkinson says 29 of the 48 national parks will open for day use, and there will be access to washrooms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for folks, particularly those who live reasonably close to national parks, to be able to get out in nature in a manner that can allow physical distancing,\u201d he told The Canadian Press.\n NO GREECE FOR YOU \n Canadians hoping to summer in Greece may have to wait longer after Greece exempted Canada from a recently released list of low COVID-19 countries from which holidaymakers can come to visit. Last week, the country\u2019s ministry of tourism released a \u2018white list\u2019 of 20 countries where its scientists judge the coronavirus infection rates to have fallen enough for tourists to be allowed into the Aegean holiday favourite, starting June 15.\nThe list, according to the Greek Reporter, includes China, Japan, Australia, Norway, Poland, Serbia, Germany, Cyprus, Israel, Denmark, Austria, Bulgaria,Romania, Albania, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia.\n ONTARIO \nFor the second day in a row, Ontario is reporting a significantly lower number of new COVID-19 cases \u2013 292, compared to daily totals in the 400s for much of the last week.

There will be justice for these residents and their families,\u201d Ford said in a briefing at Queen\u2019s Park.\nBut the horrifying details in the military report came as no surprise to close observers and critics of Ontario\u2019s long-term care system , who have long charged that the province\u2019s nursing homes have been neglected for years, leaving families stunned as they\u2019ve watched loved ones face pain, fear and inadequate care.\nHere\u2019s a list of some of the allegations in a military report on long-term care homes .\n OTTAWA \nIn a presentation to city council Wednesday, Dr. Vera Etches shared that the number of confirmed cases in institutions and in the community continue to drop, as do the number of cases that can\u2019t be linked to a known exposure to the virus. Hospitalizations are decreasing, and so, too, is ICU occupancy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of the red status \u2013 but we have a small margin of safety,\u201d said Etches. \u201cWe are in an orange zone, where we\u2019re not saying \u2018just stay home\u2019 anymore. People are starting to go about work, which is very important, they\u2019re starting to access services.

A new report by the C.D. Howe Institute warns the Liberal government against \u201cturning one-off deficits into structural deficits\u201d as Canada comes out of the first COVID-19 wave, and urges Ottawa to \u201crestore fiscal maneuvering room\u201d as soon as possible.\n SICK LEAVE \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau backed a national requirement for ten days paid sick leave Monday to get the NDP\u2019s support for the Liberal plan for Parliament this summer. \u201cWe need a commitment that the government is willing to provide paid sick leave to all Canadians,\u201d NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said at a press conference.\n OTTAWA \n Families with loved-ones in Ottawa\u2019s Madonna Care Community are now part of a proposed class-action lawsuit against two major companies that operate long-term care homes in Ontario.

The city was put into level 3 lockdown on Aug. 12 when four cases were discovered, ending the nation\u2019s 102-day run of being Covid-free, while the rest of the country was placed into level 2, requiring social distancing restrictions to be reimposed.\nArdern said Auckland will shift to level 2 on Aug. 31, allowing schools, hospitality, retail and other entities to reopen, though most gatherings will remain limited to no more than 10 people. The remainder of New Zealand will stay at level 2, with a further review of all settings to be made by Sept. 6, Ardern said.\nIn addition, the government will mandate face coverings on public transport including taxis and ride-sharing services like Uber at level 2 or higher. The new regulation is effective from Aug. 31.\nThe Auckland cluster has increased to 101 cases and the original source remains a mystery.\n\u201cThis is a contained cluster, but it is our biggest one,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cThat means the tail will be long, and the cases will keep coming for a while to come. But we can manage that. What we need to do though, is put ourselves in the best long-term position to manage it successfully, and in the most contained way we can.\u201d\nNew Zealand became the envy of the world earlier this year when it succeeded in eliminating community transmission of the coronavirus by imposing a strict nationwide lockdown. The restrictions were lifted after only seven weeks, encouraging a bounce in confidence and spending. While the Auckland lockdown may dent the economic recovery, Ardern said that was preferable to allowing the virus to get out of hand.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a decision around a four-day increase versus the potential that you come out prematurely without the full confidence that we have the cluster and the full perimeter of that cluster well understood,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cYou then run the risk of going into another transmission cycle. The idea of yo-yo-ing is very, very unsettling for an economy and comes with a high price.\u201d\nEconomists at Westpac Banking Corp. have estimated the Auckland lockdown reduces GDP by about NZ$300 million ($196 million) a week, while noting there is scope for some of that to be clawed back when the restrictions are lifted.\nLast week, the government extended a nationwide wage subsidy to businesses hit by the fresh outbreak, saying that would protect the jobs of about 930,000 workers.

A number of growers have said they may opt to stockpile part of their harvests, waiting for higher prices and an expected weakening of the local currency.\n\u201cWe are harvesting, no problem,\u201d said Eduardo Bell, a soy farmer in the Pampas grains belt town of Saladillo, Buenos Aires province, which had experienced a slowdown in trucking services.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the possibility of bagging the harvest. Prices are bad right now so it might not be a bad idea to hang on to the crop until September,\u201d he said by telephone.\nThe reference price for Argentine soybeans was $226 per tonne on Wednesday versus $245 per tonne a year ago.\n\u201cFarmers will sell the minimum amount of soy and corn needed to cover their costs, and hang onto the rest. Prices are low and Argentina, like the rest of the world, is headed for hard economic times. This all increases uncertainty,\u201d said Buenos Aires-based farm consultant Pablo Adreani.\n\u201cThe peso will probably weaken and commodity prices will likely rise as the weeks go by. When you put this all together, it makes sense for farmers to hang on to their crops for now.\u201d\nThe pandemic has struck at the worst possible time for Argentine growers as they start harvesting soy and corn, the country\u2019s main cash crops. Grains importers are relying on supplies from Argentina and Brazil ahead of the U.S. harvest, which come in the North American fall season.\nArgentine growers are expected to harvest 50 million tonnes of corn this season and 51.5 million tonnes of soy.

(Quarantine breakers, they note, are hard enough to track now.)\nThe discussion comes as the nation grapples with record numbers of COVID-19 cases, driven by huge outbreaks in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona. At the same time, Hawaii\u2019s unemployment rate remains among the highest in the nation and that\u2019s unlikely to change as long as tourism remains shut down.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really struggling to figure out what we do next to thaw out our economy,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cWe recognize that without the return of visitors, we\u2019re going to be hobbling along.

If the tariffs weren't enough of an obstacle for imports, a new monster is now affecting the industry: Coronavirus.\nThe novel coronavirus from Wuhan , or COVID-19, has been quickly growing in China for most of 2020 so far, and is beginning to take hold around the world as well. Mainland China , especially the Hubei Province , however, has at least 80% of the total cases. With this virus plaguing the country, there are a few big issues that could significantly affect the solar energy revolution.\nFirst of all, workers all over the country have been out of work for a while as a way to prevent the spread of the virus, slowing production in solar factories. And while many are slowly started to bring workers back, the effects of the slowdown are lingering.\nA few companies in the industry have spoken about this issue. China's New Energy Chamber of Commerce said this month that production had been disrupted and will affect shipments of equipment to overseas markets. Panel maker Trina had lower supplies than usual in mid-February, boosting short-term logistics costs, according to Trina's deputy general manager, Yin Rongfang. Overall, factory utilization took a hit, but is starting to rebound.\nChina is a leader in new wind and solar farm installations, and in the production of photovoltaic panels used all over the world. 9 of the top 10 cell manufacturers are based mainly in China , and they definitely hold a lot of weight in the solar industry. So this coronavirus outbreak has the chance to drastically hinder the production and implementation of solar.\nDespite this interruption in the growth of solar, there are alternative options that could help to alleviate possible damage. One is taking advantage of American-made solar products.\nLG Solar , a major manufacturer of solar panels, has recently shifted to assembling its products in the United States . Not many of the main solar companies have done this, but LG building a factory in Huntsville, Alabama has changed the place of the solar industry in our country.\nGreen Home Systems , a company that provides solar energy, as well as other home efficiency upgrades, to its customers, is partnered with LG Solar . George Castillo , a member of the marketing team at Green Home Systems , can't stress enough how beneficial it is to offer American-made solar panels to customers.\n\"Our company takes a lot of pride in our partnership with LG Solar because of how many advantages their domestic production provides,\" George says. \"Not only does it boost the American economy by creating solar jobs in the country,\" she continues, \"but it facilitates certainty and trust in our relationships with customers. And from a marketing standpoint, it doesn't hurt that Americans respond really well to 'American-made.'\"\nIn respect to coronavirus, Green Home Systems remains unaffected. In fact, they are consistently growing as a company, and remain able to continue providing their products to customers all over the country.\nGeorge comments again, \"We're worried about this virus in terms of the health and wellbeing of people all over the world, and it's definitely scary. However, we know that the United States is a strong country with the ability to keep this issue under control and protecting its citizens. We don't see it getting too powerful to handle, and we don't see it affecting our business.\"\nThis confidence gives hope that coronavirus won't significantly affect the growth of renewable energy. Despite some companies struggling to manufacture solar products due to a lack of workers, the factories are slowly making a comeback, and a couple of months of lower production shouldn't set the revolution back too far.\nAdditionally, with companies like Green Home Systems using American-made panels, providing solar to customers will not be hindered by lower factory production, as domestic factories remain unaffected for now.\nThe concern for the state of the solar revolution is not justified just yet. All that's important for now is to have empathy for the millions of people living in fear and the loved ones of those who have been affected.\nSOURCE Green Home Systems"}, {"RECORDID": "20200125-18724", "label": -1, "title": "Coronavirus contagion rate makes it hard to control - studies | Reuters", "body": "By Kate Kelland\n3 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Each person infected with coronavirus is passing the disease on to between two and three other people on average at current transmission rates, according to two separate scientific analyses of the epidemic.\nWhether the outbreak will continue to spread at this rate depends on the effectiveness of control measures, the scientists who conducted the studies said.

Scores of people have been killed in recent years as their over-crowded rickety boats have capsized or run out of water and food.\nBut even that perilous route is getting more difficult now as countries like Malaysia shut their borders, threatening to push boats back out to sea, to protect jobs and resources amid novel coronavirus lockdowns.\nSome Rohingya are clinging to the hope of a third option - resettlement in a rich country.\n\u201cI just pray and hope that one day my family will be settled in a Western country,\u201d said Mohammed Nur, who lives in a refugee camp in Bangladesh\u2019s Cox\u2019s Bazar district neighbouring Myanmar.\nNur was on a short-list for resettlement under an earlier programme.\nBut Bangladesh, which has for decades given refuge to waves of Rohingya fleeing from Myanmar, ended the resettlement programme in 2010 out of fear it would become a hub for refugees seeking to move to the West.\nNur lives in hope the programme will be revived and has even put off marriage because he worries a bigger family would see him dropped from the list.\n\u201cI\u2019m 29 now but still not married as I don\u2019t want to expand my family,\u201d he said.\nWhether a resettlement programme gets going or not depends on Bangladesh.\nBangladesh\u2019s refugee commissioner told Reuters the focus was on repatriation but his agency was ready to work to resettle refugees in other countries if his government decided to resume the programme.\nTalukder said it was up to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to request the resumption of resettlement, then his government would decide.\n\u201cIf the government takes the decision, we\u2019re ready to implement it,\u201d the commissioner, Mahbub Alam Talukder, said.\nFrom 2006 to 2010, the programme saw 920 Rohingya resettled in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States.\nBangladesh\u2019s foreign minister and the ministry\u2019s secretary did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2018THIRD-COUNTRY PATHWAYS\u2019\nThe UNHCR said it was in \u201ccontinuous dialogue\u201d with the Bangladesh government over the Rohingya.\n\u201cWe continue to pursue durable solutions for the Rohingya refugees including repatriation in safety and dignity when conditions allow, as well as through third-country pathways for those with the most acute vulnerabilities, if this option becomes available,\u201d UNHCR spokeswoman Louise Donovan said.\nBefore the programme was suspended, the UNHCR had identified here about 1,000 people for relocation, based on medical grounds or for reasons of family re-unifications.\nThe suspension left those people in limbo, some after they borrowed and even packed their bags in preparation for their move.\n\u201cWe dreamt of a better life when we got selected to be resettled in the UK,\u201d said Mohammed Ismail, 32, who fled to Bangladesh when he was only eight.\n\u201cBut my poor luck, we never could fly.\u201d\nIsmail and several others on the list with their families said they had heard nothing about the possibility of resettlement in recent years.\nBut even if Bangladesh were to agree to resume the programme, it won\u2019t be easy for Rohingya to start new lives in the West.\nH.T.

Instead, he has become a pharmaceutical sales representative - a job he dislikes but needs for the paycheque.\nGoing door-to-door to provide product information to doctors and to persuade them to prescribe the drugs to patients \"is not a decent job for a doctor, but I have no other choice to make ends meet\", al-Shimmari said.\nHowever, a lack of government funding has derailed the employment of thousands of graduates of medical universities and other health workers in Iraq at a time when the country's health institutions are limping along because of decimated infrastructure and a shortage of medical staff.\nAs a result, pressure has increased on the dwindling number of medical professionals mainly in hospitals with the onslaught of COVID-19 patients, forcing them not to take time off while in some places they work even if they have the symptoms of the disease.\n\"Fourteen months have passed now since graduation and we are staying at home,\" al-Shimmari, 26, told Al Jazeera in a phone interview from the northern city of Kirkuk.\n\"Without practising medicine, we will forget everything,\" he said.\nThe delay in employing nearly 2,300 graduates has not only affected the efforts to fight coronavirus, but has also delayed the training chain the physicians must go through, as those in service cannot move to the next level, said the head of the Iraqi Medical Association, Abdul-Ameer Muhsin Hussein.\n\"The employment of these graduates is a good addition to the health system that will bring new energy of youth,\" Hussein added.\nIraq is one of the countries badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, the confirmed cases surpassed 5,000 for the first time since the outbreak in February, bringing the total to 252,075. Total deaths stand at 7,359.\nThe health ministry has warned it fears the number of infections \"will lead our health institutions to lose control\" in the coming days.\nThe pandemic is only one issue in a long list of woes Iraq is suffering through, however.\nLike other oil-producing countries, the war-ravaged nation is taking a massive hit after oil revenues - which make up nearly 95 percent of its income - dropped more than 50 percent.\nThe months-long unrest - which started in October when Iraqis took to the streets to demand a better life - has delayed the approval of the 2020 budget.\nAlarmed by the lack of medical practitioners, the Iraqi government formed a ministerial committee in July to find ways to employ medical graduates, but the finance ministry refused because of the absence of the budget and a lack of funds.\nOn Tuesday, the cabinet issued an exemption for the newly graduated physicians to be employed, but did not give details on how to pay their salaries.\nThe decision does not cover nearly 31,000 healthcare graduates, according to Firas al-Mousawi, deputy director of state-run Al-Shafaa Centre for Crises.\nLike his colleagues, al-Shimmari is still not convinced the government is serious.\nIn a bid to stop what they call \"procrastination\" by the government in implementing the decree, the graduates are planning protests in the capital Baghdad and other cities on Sunday.\n\"The protests will run for two days,\" said al-Shimmari. \"If nothing will happen then there will be a partial strike by those in service except emergency wards and intensive care units, and later we'll start a general strike.\"\nIraq's health system has suffered in recent years as more than 20,000 doctors fled because of insecurity, threats, and targeted killings, leaving the country with less than 30,000 doctors, according to Iraqi Medical Association.\nAnd 363 doctors were assassinated while hundreds endured kidnappings since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, an attack that unleashed instability and chaos that persists to this day.\nWhat has further strained the health system, Hussein continued, is the new retirement law that went into effect this year, which mandates the retirement at 60, forcing more than 3,000 senior doctors out of the healthcare system.\n\"To be honest, there is a huge shortage of mainly doctors as well as health workers,\" said Hussein. He added the country has one of the lowest numbers of doctors and nurses per capita, standing at about 0.8 doctors per 1,000 people.\nOne of the major obstacles for doctors and medical workers \"is the absence of a safe environment as they increasingly face harassment and assaults from disgruntled families of patients\", Hussein said. He is pushing authorities to deal with attacks against medical staff using the anti-terrorism law.\nDeteriorated health infrastructure and a lack of protective gear while dealing with coronavirus patients have caused infections among doctors, he said. Since the outbreak, 44 doctors have died while more than 1,500 others were infected, a number that could be even higher.\nHealthcare graduate from Baghdad, Mayssam Muqdad Mahmoud, 26, describes delaying their employment as \"unfair as we are left in the middle of nowhere and we don't know our fate\".\n\"We are all disappointed and shocked,\" she said. \"What is the government waiting for amidst the current crisis of coronavirus and shortage of medical staff?\"\nShe said she is upset at being a \"housewife\" after studying medicine for six years.

Cory Bombredi, an internal organizer for SEIU Local 888, which represents 270 members of the home's staff, said that according to his data the facility has been operating at 80% staffing levels for the past few years. Within the past two years, Bombredi said that the facility had fired 70 certified nurse's assistants and licensed practical nurses.\n\n\n\"They've gone through all the available workforce\" in the western Massachusetts region, Bombredi said. Emails and meeting agendas from both 2019 and earlier this year show repeated concerns expressed by the union about mandatory overtime being used in place of adequate staffing.\nMassachusetts Health and Human Services, which oversees the facility, declined to respond to the union allegations despite repeated attempts by CNN.\nStaffing-wise, many nurses are working overtime and quick turnarounds right now according to the nurse.\nWhen staff started to get sick during March, the nurse said that the home began consolidating veteran units to allow for the smaller staff to administer to more veterans at once -- for example, nine veterans shared a dining room together as a unit, and 3-person bedrooms accommodated four veterans.\n\"We already were having staffing issues, already understaffed, so I don't think they were prepared for the amount of staff that became ill and had to leave,so then they had to combine units so there were more veterans per staff member,\" the nurse told CNN.\nBombredi explained that the dining room, which does not normally accommodate beds, didn't have adequate electricity hook ups, leaving the beds for veterans unable to move up and down for their comfort and for the caregivers to be able to attend to them more comfortably. The nurse and Bombredi also said that the facility mixed in veterans who were being tested for Covid-19 with other residents.\n\"This is a building that clearly housed all of these veterans in their own private setting,\" Bombredi said. \"For whatever reason, the team of managers thought the best course of action was to combine sick veterans with healthy veterans.\"\nErin Saykin, a certified nurse's aide who has worked at the home for 16 years, echoed these same concerns. Saykin said that the staff were instructed to wear simple surgical masks and gowns which she said were not normally used and that they did not have access to N95 masks. Bombredi also told CNN that he had heard from other staff that they did not have proper access to proper personal protective equipment.\nDuring her overtime shifts, Saykin worked with a patient who would later test positive. That veteran was mixed in a room with other veterans, she said. She believes the patient should have been isolated, despite the difficulty in isolating some patients who have dementia.\n\"He should've been moved off the unit, closed off from everyone,\" Saykin said.\n\n\nSaykin woke up in the middle of the night after her shift and felt like she couldn't breathe. She was tested and learned she was positive for Covid-19, and has been recovering at home for more than two weeks.\nLast week, CNN reported that a nurse in the home was reprimanded in March for wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). The worker -- a caregiver -- says he first came into contact with a veteran with symptoms consistent with Covid-19, who was not isolated, but rather walking around and coughing, and while working on a different floor at the facility he also observed a second veteran displaying symptoms. The employee's actions were called \"disruptive\" and \"extremely inappropriate\" which purportedly \"alarmed staff.\"\n\"We don't have a voice to challenge what management decides,\" the second nurse who wished to remain anonymous said when asked if any of these concerns had been raised with management. The nurse said that the staff is worried about not only their own safety, but also the safety of their family members.\nUnion representative Bombredi confirmed he had heard many of the same concerns of the nurse and Saykin from other members.\n\"This isn't one or two of my workers telling me these stories,\" Bombredi said. \"This is, at this point, a majority, and they're all telling an identical story.\"\nThe union filed an official grievance on behalf of its members on Saturday demanding that four other additional management members be placed on leave, in addition to the superintendent of the home who has already been placed on leave .\n\"We need insurance that they're going to have a thorough investigation,\" Bombredi said. \"At this point we're going to need to see an entirely new team of management take over that home to have any confidence going forward.\"\nSlideshow by photo services\nAs of Monday, 25 veteran residents have died since March, 18 of whom have tested positive for Covid19 with three additional results pending.\nA total of 59 veteran residents have tested positive along with 31 staff according to the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services. Last week, Gov.

The slump in existing home sales reflected closings on contracts signed in March and April, when nearly the whole country was under lockdowns to slow the spread of the respiratory illness.\nWith applications for home loans surging to an 11-year high in recent weeks amid record low mortgage rates, May was probably the nadir for the existing housing market. Data last week showed a sharp rebound in building permits in May. But nearly 20 million people are unemployed and housing supply remains tight.\n\"Home sales may bounce with pent-up demand following the shutdown of the economy starting in March, but the massive scale of job losses and cautious consumers rebuilding their savings may limit sales,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. \"There is still a long road to recovery for the broader economy.\"\nExisting home sales fell 9.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91 million units last month, the lowest level since October 2010. It was the third straight monthly drop. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would fall 3% to a rate of 4.12 million units in May.\nHome resales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, decreased 26.6% on a year-on-year basis in May, the largest annual decline since 1982. There were 1.55 million previously owned homes on the market in May, down 18.8% from a year ago.\nStocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors weighed stimulus-fueled recovery hopes against an increase in U.S. coronavirus infections. The PHLX housing index <.HGX> was little changed. The dollar <.DXY> fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.\nSHIFT TO SUBURBS\nHome sales fell in all four regions last month. The NAR said with many companies allowing greater flexibility for employees to work from home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for housing was skewed towards single-family homes, mostly in the suburbs.\nEconomists believe the migration to suburbs from city centers could ease some of the housing shortage. A homebuilder survey last week showed strong demand in June for single-family homes in inner and outer suburbs featuring lower density neighborhoods.\nSingle-family home sales dropped 24.8% in May from a year ago, while multi-family homes plunged 41.4%.\nThe median existing house price rose 2.3% from a year ago to $284,600 in May. That was the smallest gain since February 2012. Though single-family home prices increased, the median condominium price fell.\n\"Although demand certainly dropped in March and April due to the crisis, supply dropped even more, and has thus far kept home prices from declining,\" said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. \"We expect that home price growth will pick up over the summer due to insufficient supply levels.\"\nLast month's slump in home sales, together with a modest rise in homebuilding in May, suggested a big drop in residential investment this quarter after it grew at its fastest rate in more than seven years in the first quarter.\nEconomists are forecasting residential investment will decline at around a 20% annualized rate in the second quarter. That would contribute to gross domestic product sinking at as much as a 37.5% pace during that period, they say.\nThe economy contracted at a 5% rate in the first quarter, the sharpest since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.\nAt May's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to exhaust the current inventory of pre-owned homes on the market, up from 4.3 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.\nLast month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 26 days, down from 27 days in April, but matching the duration a year ago. Fifty-eight percent of homes sold in May were on the market for less than a month.\nFirst-time buyers accounted for 34% of sales in May, down from 36% in April but up from 32% a year ago.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)"}, {"RECORDID": "20200709-61592", "label": -1, "title": "Italy seizes German-flagged charity vessel for breaking safety rules | Reuters", "body": "By Reuters Staff\n2 Min Read\nROME, July 9 (Reuters) - Italian authorities have seized a boat operated by a German NGO that last month rescued more than 200 people stranded at sea, because it did not comply with safety rules, the Coast Guard said on Thursday.\nIn April, Italy banned migrant rescue ships from docking in its ports until July 31 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Is the 1.1 trillion euros set aside for bond purchases this year enough?\nMarket watchers suspect the ECB will have to expand asset purchases given the ballooning government debt issuance required to finance spending to contain the coronavirus fallout.\nABN AMRO estimates that euro area government funding needs have risen by an additional 690 billion euros. The ECB is undertaking 750 billion euros of emergency purchases on top of the 120 billion euros of purchases added to its conventional bond-buying scheme in March. With around 60-65% of this going towards sovereign debt, ABN says increased purchases will not be enough to cover additional debt issued.\nA front-loading of asset purchases to help vulnerable peripheral states also suggests the ECB may need to top up its emergency scheme soon.\nAt the current daily pace emergency ECB bond buys will be exhausted by October, two banks estimate. Even hawkish policymakers such as the Netherlands' Klaas Knot are not ruling out an increase in emergency bond purchases.\nFor an interactive version of the below chart, click here https://reut.rs/2XVvBso.\n2. What other measures could the ECB take?\nThe ECB appears willing to take additional measures after saying last week that it would lend against some junk assets.\n\"That's really a huge step, because the ECB has never wanted to accept junk at all,\" said Piet Haines Christiansen, chief strategist, ECB and fixed income, at Danske Bank.\nNext, the ECB could extend the collateral allowance to all higher-rated junk debt and make outright purchases of debt from newly downgraded \"fallen angels\", ING analysts said.\nOther options include buying exchange-traded funds, bank bonds, offering even more favourable terms on cheap multi-year bank loans and increasing the multiplier on the ECB's tiered rate. This exempts banks from taking an effective penalty due to negative interest rates for their excess reserves at the ECB.\nPictet Wealth Management's global strategist Frederic Ducrozet reckons the multiplier could increase to eight times excess reserves, from the current six times.\n3. How deep will the recession be, and how quick the recovery?\nThe ECB is bracing for a \"large contraction\" in economic growth. Markets, trying to assess whether more stimulus is coming soon, want details on how policymakers see the recovery playing out.\nFaced with an unparalleled shutdown in economic activity to contain the coronavirus, forecasting the recovery is challenging. A Reuters polls shows economists' forecasts for 2020 growth range from 0% to minus 16.1%.\n\"I am more interested in how the ECB sees the shape of the recovery -- the important question is if we get growth in the third and fourth quarters,\" said AXA Investment Managers chief economist Gilles Moec.\nFor interactive versions of the below charts, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2Vuox4j.\n4. How concerned is the ECB about increased non-performing loans?\nThe Bank of Italy has warned the coronavirus crisis could drive up the share of bank loans turning sour. Unease is also rising in Portugal, where the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for banks fell to 6.1% of total credit in December, from 17.9% in mid-2016, but remains about twice the European average.\nHaving eased collateral requirements and offered generous terms on cheap loans to support banks, the ECB may now be asked whether it is prepared to buy NPLs.\nFor some economists, transferring NPLs created during the pandemic to the ECB balance sheet would send a powerful message. But they stress this is complicated by the ECB's bank supervisory role.\n\"The longer the crisis lingers, the greater the risk that loans might never recover,\" said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management. \"I cannot see the ECB buying NPLs. But, in its role as banking supervisor, it can certainly exert pressure on banks to tackle their own issues.\"\nFor an interactive version of the below graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/3eU0J1w.\n5. Could the ECB give clarity on what it's buying under emergency bond purchases?\nThe ECB publishes a breakdown of bond purchases for its quantitative easing programme but not for its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. It could be pressed for more clarity.\nGreater transparency on the PEPP could help shore up confidence in Italy's bonds, whose yields are rising again.\n\"In the current environment of elevated economic, financial and political uncertainty, we fear that the lack of transparency about PEPP purchases could fuel conspiracy theories about the ECB's support, or lack thereof,\" said Pictet's Ducrozet.\nThe ECB may also be asked whether it could change its mind about reinvesting funds from maturing bonds bought under PEPP.\nDoing so could have a significant impact on Italian bonds and reduce the need for the ECB to scale Italian debt purchases to contain rising borrowing costs, said AXA's Moec.\n(Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Yoruk Bahceli; Graphics by Ritvik Carvalho; Editing by Tommy Wilkes and Catherine Evans)"}, {"RECORDID": "20200310-56405", "label": -1, "title": "Coronavirus Vs. 2008 Financial Crisis", "body": "All the US indices plummeted in trading today as an oil price war commences, and the coronavirus outbreak creates what the markets are seeing as an \u201cimpending\u201d economic fallout.

The fear index, the VIX, has spiked to its highest level since the 2008 recession as the market\u2019s uncertainty hits a high. The spread of the coronavirus is undoubtedly going to continue, but will this lead to an economic downturn?\nThe Coronavirus Vs. 2008 Financial Crisis?\nRight now, the impact of the coronavirus is merely causing a short-term earnings recession due to the disrupted supply chains and hampered global demand. Balance sheets, on the other hand, remain healthy and quite liquid. This is very different from the 2008 crisis, where the backbone of US finance, the banks, had toxic balance sheets and couldn\u2019t provide proper liquidity.\nThe issue with the coronavirus crisis is that the markets have never dealt with anything quite like it before. They have no way to model for expected outcomes, and once the models begin to lose their integrity, funds & institutional investors panic.\nThe Federal Reserve has cut rates by 50 basis points so far this month, and the markets are pricing in another unprecedented 100 basis point cut for next week\u2019s meeting. This cut would push the Fed Funds rate to 0-25 basis points, and leave the FOMC with no more bullets for any other economic emergency.\nThese rate cuts will provide a massive upside for companies (that aren\u2019t banks) once this coronavirus is controlled\u2014allowing companies to borrow money at a discounted rate. This virus\u2019s timeline is the biggest unknown right now. How long will it last, and how many more people will be affected?\nChina has proved that this virus can be contained through draconian measures, as the country\u2019s new cases have appeared to level off. The country shutdowns cities, which caused the supply shock to the world economy that has shuddered the global financial markets. More international border blocks will likely be the next steps and will further inhibit worldwide supply and demand.\nTrump and his administration\u2019s laissez faire attitude toward the coronavirus has been another significant cause of market anxiety. Trump is trying to brush this issue under the rug, saying that it is not much more than a cold. Once the infection\u2019s spread becomes dire, Trump will scramble and take substantial measures to preserve the economy and the stock market. Once the government starts panicking, the financial markets will begin to relax, and a V-shaped recovery will follow.\nWhat I am Doing\nNow is the time to be very vigilant with your money, buying up your favorite stocks a little at a time and averaging down your price, for robust long-term investment strategy.\nI like blue-chip cloud players like Microsoft MSFT, Adobe ADBE, and Alibaba BABA, which I have begun averaging down on.\nI am also buying up some 3.5 month calls in the Nasdaq-100 index tracker QQQ and S&P 500 tracker SPY.

There are no other comparable scenarios that the markets can use as a benchmark, and models are no longer reliable. It is unclear what the full impact of the coronavirus will have on the world and its economy.\nI, for one, am buying the dip, but only in small portions.

Throughout his tenure as the vice-president to a president famed for a bottomless appetite for flattery and paranoia about disloyalty, Pence has understandably chosen to serve as Sycophant-in-Chief, forever extolling the Sun King\u2019s strength and brilliance (most famously via tributes to Trump\u2019s \u201cbroad shoulders\u201d ). As the Pence-watchers Michael D\u2019Antonio and Peter Eisner noted in 2018, the veep\u2019s obsequiousness can become just too much for some observers:\n[T]he intensity of Pence\u2019s fawning has led George Will to describe him as \u201c America\u2019s most repulsive figure .\u201d The vice president reached the nadir of his toady ways at the end of last year when he spent three minutes extolling Trump at a Cabinet meeting and managed to work in one note of praise every 12 seconds .\nAll this makes you wonder how exactly Pence is going to manage to stand out at a convention in which hymns of praise for POTUS have already filled the air regularly? I mean, how can he compete with Eric Trump\u2019s heartfelt \u201cLove you daddy!\u201d plea for attention (right out of the HBO series Succession ) on night two?\nPerhaps one key to Pence\u2019s mission is to recall that he has a unique role in the administration on one issue where generalized flattery of Trump is not quite enough: management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first two days of the convention have made it plain that promotion of two particular lies are central to the event\u2019s strategic purpose. The first is that Joe Biden wants to defund police and turn over America\u2019s white suburbs to Black rioters. But the second, perhaps even more important, is to rewrite the history of Trump\u2019s disastrous engagement with COVID-19. As chairman of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and its most visible symbol in the early days of the pandemic, Pence can \u2014 and really must \u2014 reinforce the claim that the administration saved millions of lives with its speedy and effective response. The convention has already spent considerable time promoting that fairy tale, as Slate\u2019s William Saletan notes :\nConvention speakers and videos extolled Trump\u2019s response to the virus as \u201cswift\u201d and \u201cquick.\u201d One speaker, a nurse, claimed that the president \u201c made rapid policy changes \u201d because he \u201crecognized the threat this virus presented for all American early on.\u201d Another speaker, a doctor, said Trump\u2019s \u201c decisive leadership led to a rapid and efficient response .\u201d That\u2019s all nonsense. A thorough review of the record shows that Trump dragged his feet, downplayed the threat, and slowed every element of the government\u2019s response.\nTrump has lied about the virus all along. He\u2019s still lying. \u201c We just have to make this China virus go away. And it\u2019s happening ,\u201d he declared in a convention video, even as thousands of Americans continue to die . But the president is no longer alone in his fictional universe. He\u2019s backed by a party that glorifies him with fabrications: that he stood up to North Korea , that his impeachment was \u201c fake ,\u201d and that he \u201c ended once and for all the policy of incarceration of Black people .\u201d The tale of his struggle against the virus is just another heroic myth.\nAs Trump\u2019s copilot in his perilous flight of epidemiological folly, Pence can be expected to breathlessly testify to the president\u2019s calm and courageous course of action on COVID-19.\nIn doing so, will Pence be damaging his long-term credibility? Quite possibly, though his conservative Evangelical friends who view him as their man in the White House have devised ways for the veep to cross his fingers behind his back whenever he\u2019s called upon to bear false witness on behalf of his self-aggrandizing boss. One theory is that he is bound by the biblical principle of \u201cservant leadership\u201d to tug his forelock in the presence of his demanding superior. Another more elaborate theory casts him in the role of the Hebrew scriptural figure Daniel, hiding his Judaism in order to serve the interests of God\u2019s people in the court of the pagan King Nebuchadnezzar. Either way, if lying for Trump is the only way to keep Pence\u2019s feet on the path to his own presidency, as some of his fans (and perhaps the veep himself) believe is his divinely established destiny , then so be it."}, {"RECORDID": "20200325-104622", "label": 0, "title": "Gilead asks FDA to take back lucrative orphan drug status on possible coronavirus treatment | Reuters", "body": "By Manas Mishra , Michael Erman\n3 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc on Wednesday took the unusual step of asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to rescind a controversial orphan drug designation the agency had granted for the biotech company\u2019s potential coronavirus treatment remdesivir just 48 hours earlier.\nThe FDA agreed to the withdrawal, and said it is actively working to speed development of medical products desperately needed to prevent or treat the highly contagious COVID-19 illness caused by the virus.\nShares of the California-based company closed down nearly 6% at $69.66.\nThe company was criticized by lawmakers and patient advocates after receiving the orphan designation on Monday for the experimental antiviral drug, saying it was taking advantage of the rapidly accelerating health crisis.\nThe drug, which previously failed as an Ebola treatment, is being tried on COVID-19 patients.

In January 2020, the joint venture discovered 240 feet (73 metres) of oil reservoirs, and 164 feet (50 metres) of hydrocarbon-bearing light oil and gas condensate pay.

A similar trend can be noticed for Apache Corporation, which registered an intraday gain of 16.67%. This new discovery in offshore Suriname comes at a time when global crude oil is struggling due to the sudden global economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and is therefore encouraging for these companies.\n\nPain of Choppy Oil Prices Prevails Year to date, the price of crude oil has dropped 59.4%, which is adversely impacting the performance and operation of every oil and gas company. The weakness in oil prices is due to supply glut and weak global demand for crude oil owing to lockdown in most of the countries across the globe to fight coronavirus. On top of it, Saudi Arabia \u2014 the world\u2019s top oil exporter \u2014 has plans to increase crude oil production to 12.3 million barrels per day in April. Additionally, Russia\u2019s increase in oil output is not helping the oil prices. Expectation of crude oil production cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia after a tweet suggesting the same by the U.S. President raised hopes among oil and gas companies. However, Saudi Arabia and Russian governments are yet to make any official announcement regarding production cuts. Unless any formal announcement is made to lower production, oil and gas producers will have to sustain in this weak commodity price environment. TOTAL lowered its 2020 capital expenditure guidance by nearly 20% to less than $15 billion from the prior expectation of $18 billion, after taking into consideration the ongoing decline in commodity prices.\u00a0 The ongoing volatility in the commodity price has forced oil and gas companies like Occidental Petroleum OXY, Devon Energy Corporation DVN and Murphy Oil Corporation to lower their 2020 capital expenditure twice in the recent past to preserve liquidity.

Officials did not name the brand.\nHealth authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have said the possibility of catching the virus through food is low.\nShenzhen health authorities immediately traced and tested people who might have come into contact with the product, and all results came back negative; all related products in stock have been sealed off and tested negative, the statement said.\nAuthorities are now tracing related products from the same brand that have already been sold, and have disinfected the area where the contaminated chicken wings were stored.\nThe Brazilian Association of Animal Protein (ABPA) said in a statement that it is analyzing the incident and reiterated that \"there is no scientific evidence that meat transmits the virus.\"\n\"It is not yet clear when the packaging was contaminated, and whether it occurred during the export transportation process,\" ABPA added.\nThe Brazilian agriculture ministry released a note stating that it has not been officially notified by Chinese authorities of the incident.\nBrazil has so far reported more than 3.1 million coronavirus cases, the second highest in the world after the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally.\nNews of the contaminated chicken wings comes a day after coronavirus was found on the packaging of shrimps imported from Ecuador, another South American country, at a restaurant in eastern Anhui province during a routine inspection, China's state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nSince July, there have been seven instances where the virus was detected on the packaging of imported seafood products across the country, from Shandong province on the eastern coast to the municipality of Chongqing in the west, according to state media reports .\nThese incidents have sparked concerns over the safety of imported foods. Chinese health authorities have repeatedly told the public to be cautious about buying imported meat and seafood.

Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply,\" the WHO says.\nDavid Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the imported food products that tested positive in China were almost certain to have been contaminated during packaging.\nBut he said it doesn't necessarily mean that they're infectious -- the nucleic acid tests could be picking up the RNA of dead virus. These remnants of the virus are known to have caused false positive results on patients who have recovered from the coronavirus, such as in South Korea.\nIf the virus taken from the food products can be grown in labs, however, then they are infectious, he said, adding that the coronavirus can survive freezing temperatures and still be active when thawed.\n\n\nChinese authorities have increased screening of imported meat and seafood products since June, when a coronavirus outbreak in Beijing emerged from the city's largest wholesale food market.\n\nState media reported at the time that the virus was discovered on a chopping board used for imported salmon at the market, prompting supermarkets in the Chinese capital to remove salmon from their shelves.\nBut officials at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have tried to allay concerns. \"We cannot conclude that salmon is the source of infection just because novel coronavirus was detected on a chopping board of a seller,\" Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, told the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.\nWu said the chopping board could instead have been contaminated by an infected owner or customers, or other products that carried the virus.\nIn July, a fresh coronavirus outbreak in the city of Dalian in northern China's Liaoning province was linked to a seafood company , which processes both imported and domestic seafood.\nThe headline on this story has been updated to add more context."}, {"RECORDID": "20200622-1665", "label": 1, "title": "Live Nation Unveils First Drive-in Concert Series With Brad Paisley, Darius Rucker, Nelly", "body": "Click here to read the full article.\nAs the coronavirus pandemic has seized up the live-entertainment industry, drive-in concerts have been floated as a safe replacement for audiences jonesing for live music \u2014 and Live Nation has announced the first large-scale drive-in concert series in the U.S., beginning in July.\nThe live-entertainment giant on Monday announced \u201cLive from the Drive-In,\u201d a series of nine concerts taking place July 10-12 in Nashville, Tennessee; Maryland Heights, Missouri; and Noblesville, Indiana.\nMore from Variety\nBTS and Big Hit Entertainment Donate $1 Million to Crew Nation Charity\nLive Nation to Reduce Payments to Artists in 2021\nMadonna, U2 Manager Guy Oseary No Longer Running Maverick; What Does it Mean for the Collective?\nCountry star Brad Paisley will headline shows in all three cities, and will be joined by Darius Rucker and Jon Pardi in Nashville at Nissan Stadium, with country-adjacent rapper Nelly performing in Maryland Heights, near St. Louis.

But in a statement late Wednesday, the company said LMVH is opposing its efforts to hold an expedited trial and asked the court to hold off for six or seven months\nFarah, who negotiated the deal, said: \u201cLVMH\u2019s opposition to our motion to expedite is the latest attempt to run out the clock to avoid fulfilling its obligations under the merger agreement. If LVMH were confident in its legal position, it would have no reason to oppose an expedited trial schedule. We urge the court to hold the trial on a timetable that will enable a decision before the November 24 termination date in the merger agreement.\u201d\nHe said Tiffany was not for sale when LVMH came knocking last fall and that the company only sold once the price was increased five times \u2014 to $135 a share in what he described as an \u201cironclad contract.\u201d\n\u201cFor many months, LVMH has been grasping at any opportunity to delay and avoid its obligations,\u201d Farah said. \u201cThis includes excuses for failing to make standard antitrust filings, complaints about the pandemic, and protests that LVMH previously agreed could not be considered as a valid reason to question the transaction. Then, LVMH produced a non-binding advisory letter from a French government official that requests further delay in closing. However, this letter does not change LVMH\u2019s obligations to close immediately upon receipt of the required regulatory approvals. LVMH\u2019s shifting explanations indicate bad faith in its dealings with Tiffany and are nothing more than distractions meant to hide its efforts to run out the clock and avoid fulfilling its obligations.\u201d\nFarah said LVMH does not have the right to unilaterally exit the deal or to reduce its price \u201cjust because it is now suffering from a case of buyer\u2019s remorse.\u201d\nAfter Tiffany filed suit to keep LVMH in the deal, LVMH fired back last week and said the legal action was \u201ctotally unfounded\u201d and vowed to \u201cdefend itself vigorously.\u201d\nLVMH said that it was working through the regulatory approvals and also said it was disappointed in how Tiffany was managed during the coronavirus crisis.\n\u201cThe first-half results and its perspectives for 2020 are very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable brands of the LVMH Group during this period,\u201d it said.\nAllessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany chief executive officer, stepped up to defend the company\u2019s performance.\n\u201cLVMH\u2019s allegations regarding mismanagement are both untrue and legally irrelevant,\u201d Bogliolo said. \u201cWe have already returned to profitability and expect to remain profitable for the balance of the year, with fourth quarter profits actually exceeding those of the fourth quarter of 2019. Tiffany\u2019s brand, style, sophistication, unparalleled design and unique heritage have inspired customers since 1837 and will continue to do so long after this pandemic is over. The only standard under the merger agreement is whether Tiffany has breached its covenants \u2014 and we have not.\u201d\nTiffany in its statement also argued that there has been no \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d \u2014 referring to a clause in the contract that makes allowances for when a company is hit particularly hard by some negative effect.\n\u201cAny impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S. social justice protests cannot even be considered in determining whether an MAE has occurred,\u201d Tiffany said.\nThe jeweler also maintained that the merger agreement required that it continue to pay dividends, where LVMH has pointed to the dividends as outside the ordinary course of business when the firm was losing money during the COVID shutdown.\nAnd all of that seems to be just preamble.

But this clarity can be hard to achieve under normal circumstances and is even more challenging now, as organizations experience many shifting dynamics and business priority resets in 2020,\" said Alex Hood, Head of Product, Asana. \"According to our survey findings, employees using a collaborative work management tool like Asana are nearly twice as likely to say that they have a clear understanding of how their individual work relates to their company wide goals.\"\nHood continues, \"Today, we\u2019re building on the clarity that work management platforms provide with the introduction of Asana Goals which are OKRs done right.

Goals let every team member on every team see how their work contributes to organizational goals, why certain work is being prioritized, and what impact that work has on the achievement of their company\u2019s mission. With this level of clarity, organizations can create an empowering sense of purpose for teams, motivating them to do their best work so they can achieve more ambitious goals.\nToday, customers on Asana\u2019s Business and Enterprise offerings can achieve unmatched organizational alignment via:\nCompany Goals: Longer-term goals tied to the achievement of your organization\u2019s mission.\nTeam Goals: Shorter-term goals that ladder up to the company\u2019s mission-oriented objectives.\nUnlike setting and tracking goals in emails, spreadsheets or OKR software, Asana Goals enables everyone to manage goals and the actual work needed to achieve them in one place. By linking Goals across projects and entire Portfolios, leaders now have a bird\u2019s-eye view of how teams are progressing on strategic initiatives, ultimately prioritizing the right work and seeing when and where initiatives are at-risk, before it\u2019s too late. When a goal is off track, teams can drill down into the strategy, project and task that\u2019s at risk \u2014 helping them to take corrective action instantly.\n\"We used to track our goals the way most companies do\u2014in a spreadsheet. But we couldn't see progress in real time or proactively spot risks,\" said Michael Chidgey, PMO and Program Manager, SiteMinder . \"Now with Goals in Asana, we can track our quarterly goals alongside our work to stay aligned and on track.\"\nBy making Goals visible to everyone, individuals across every level of an organization have clarity on the company\u2019s priorities at any given time. As teams become increasingly distributed as a result of the rapid shift to remote work, Goals ensure that when changes occur to company priorities and initiatives, organizational leaders won\u2019t need to spend countless hours remapping priority initiatives. Instead, they can revise goals and pivot business focus instantly to pursue their highest-value work.\n\"We have reached the point where employee goals can be tied to the systems that support the work being done.

Within the next few weeks, they successfully launched their Sunday services, well before the state of Montana began experiencing changes prompted by the novel coronavirus.\n\"That was not necessarily 100% in response (to the coronavirus) but we saw what was going on,\" said Jason. \"We thought, you know, we need to bolster our takeout business a little more and so that's when we started putting that together.\"\n\nIn response to the growing threat of COVID-19, we are offering all coronavirus-related content free as a public service. Please consider subscribing today to support important journalism like this.\nWithin the next four weeks\u00a0the COVID-19 pandemic prompted restaurants, like the Roadhouse Diner,\u00a0to convert to takeout or delivery only options.\nThe official order to temporarily halt dine-in services at restaurants and bars came from the City-County Health Department on March 19, followed by a statewide order from Gov. Steve Bullock the following day.\nJason said\u00a0the Roadhouse Diner's\u00a0proactive approach to establishing even a single day of takeout only service has allowed them to transition seamlessly.\n\"We've had a good month to really promote it and get people in here and develop our system so everything runs smooth,\" said Jason. \"That's been really a positive thing where it would be much more difficult trying to undertake that right now in the middle of everything going on.\"\nCOVID-19 news:  Bullock plans to extend stay-at-home order, other directives, beyond April 10\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on local businesses in Great Falls is varied and leaves room for uncertainty as social distancing and other restrictions persist into April.\nFor Shane Etzwiler, CEO and President of the the Great Falls Area Chamber of Commerce, he hopes that local business owners are prepared to weather\u00a0the storm.\nHe explained that the cancellation of Western Art Week with the C.M. Russell Museum was the first major hit to the business community due to COVID-19.\n\"It hit our hotels, hit our restaurants, you know, kind of hit those in the travel industry first, then we continued to see the ripple through retail and things like that,\" said Etzwiler. \"So our No. 1\u00a0concern is, hopefully they have been somewhat prepared for a crisis or an emergency situation, and secondly is everyone getting through it together and coming out on the other side.\"\nDespite the Beams' efforts to prepare for the pandemic at their business, there have been some challenges that have required creative problem solving to overcome.\nJason said that because the restaurant uses local, fresh ingredients, it has been challenging to offer their full menu. He said that local grocery stores have been helpful in finding ways to accommodate his business even though it's been difficult for them to keep their shelves stocked.\n\"I'm kind of communicating with them and they're making sure that they can get us some of the stuff we buy in bulk and making sure it's in stock,\" said Jason. \"When it comes in they earmark it to make sure that we have enough and that they have enough for their customers.\n\"Some of those local vendors that we use have been extremely helpful with us to make sure we can get our products so that we can stay open, so we can offer our customers the full menu,\" he said. \"That's been a challenge, but, you know, our local grocery stores have really risen to the occasion to help us out in that endeavor.\"\nThe remaining challenges facing Roadhouse Diner are in terms of staffing and fewer travelers in the area. Because customers don't have the option to dine-in at the restaurant, it results in fewer patrons daily and, in turn, reduces the need for a full staff.\n\"We've had to cut hours, unfortunately we've lost most of the front-of-the-house-staff because we're a full-service restaurant so we are down to only one person helping us out front,\" said Jason.\nRight now, work schedules for staff at the Roadhouse Diner varies from day-to-day and every employee has been subject to their hours being cut back.\n\"I'm trying to give people hours when we can necessitate it,\" he said.\nCoronavirus:  Navigating the Cascade County court system during COVID-19\nRestaurants aren't the only local businesses that have been impacted by social distancing recommendations and stay-at-home orders. Local retailers have had to either close their operations entirely or find a way to adapt.\nFor Beth Leatham and her husband Chris, owners of Big Horn Outdoor Specialists,\u00a0that's meant finding ways to make their inventory accessible online for customers to browse.\n\"We've taken a couple of giant technological leaps that we had been intending to take for a while, but you know, we took them in 48 hours instead of six months, so that was pretty intense,\" said Beth.\nBig Horn has been able to list a wide variety of its products online through a website called Locally . Customers can purchase items online through the website, and then pick up the product curbside at Big Horn's location downtown, or have the item shipped to them.\nThe local outdoor sporting goods store also launched a Facebook group called BIGHORN BACKROOM BARGAINS , where employees post clearance items daily for shoppers to claim virtually. Once an item is claimed the customer can purchase the item over the phone, and has the option for the item to be delivered or picked up curb-side. As of Friday, the group has 295 members.\nWhile the those technological advances have allowed the store to maintain daily sales, it still doesn't compare to the traffic and seasonal sales that they normally get.\u00a0Beth explained that spring usually prompts luggage and travel sales as people embark on spring vacations and prepare for summer adventures.\n\"But we are seeing a lot more interest expressed in things that people can do locally, like cross country skiing, snowshoeing and maybe even just a new pair of running shoes to go walking with the dog,\" she said.\nCustomers can reserve rental equipment by calling Big Horn Outdoor Specialists. More information about the shop's rental equipment can be found online at their website.\n\"We're trying to make it as easy as possible for our local community to maintain their mental health and probably one of the best things that Montanans can do for ourselves is to get outside underneath that big blue sky,\" said Beth. \"So whenever possible we're taking rental reservations over the phone and getting the gear all set up.\"\nOther challenges that are facing Big Horn include that the \"global supply chain is grinding to a screeching halt,\" which impedes the retailer's ability to receive and order products. At this point, Big Horn Outdoor Specialists has only received about half of it's anticipated spring inventory.\n\"There's a big question of whether we should go ahead and take delivery of orders that we haven't taken yet (or) if we should cancel them. It's very hard to predict what the economy is going to do,\" said Beth.\nBeth said that the store is \"pretty reliant\" on the summer months due to park-to-park traffic between Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park. Social distancing recommendations and travel restrictions across the country has also made it difficult to anticipate what summer travel might be impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"So that comes right down to how many staff members do we need for the spring. Should we order as much bear spray as we ordered last year?\" asked Beth.\n\"We're pretty fortunate that we're sitting in a pretty good position and so we're still going to be here in a couple of months,\" she continued. \"But I think, just like everybody else, we're wondering what a couple of months from now is going to look like.\"\nIn terms of staffing, Beth said that they haven't had to lay any employees off yet, and they are working to accommodate employees comfort levels during the pandemic. Some employees are able to work from home, some are on a flexible schedule and others are working their regularly scheduled shifts.\nCOVID-19 in Montana:  Small town of Shelby dealing with coronavirus deaths\nAlthough Big Horn Outdoor Specialists has been able to adapt it's business without laying off employees, other local retailers have not been able to make those leaps.\nAlison Fried, the owner of the boutique Dragonfly Dry Goods, said she laid off all five of her employees after closing her store in Bozeman and Great Falls because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nShe first began really considering the impacts the virus could have on her business in early March. She saw many of her friends that own boutiques across the country making changes to their businesses or completely shutting down\u00a0\u2014 especially on the coasts.\n\"We essentially, at this point, have zero dollars coming in,\" said Fried. \"The week before we closed we had between one and five people in the store a day. We usually have 30 to 50 a day.\"\nFried said that even though her doors are closed, she is still posting photos of available items on Facebook to generate sales. However, it is no\u00a0match to the normal foot traffic her shop experiences. Over the course of 10 days she only had two people reach out to her to buy something.\n\"I'm an event-driven business, so when you have a baby or you have a wedding or you are going to go on a trip, you come and see me and we supply those needs,\" said Fried. \"None of that's happening anymore so it's totally understandable to me that people are not interested in that.\"\nStory continues below\nEvery passing day makes it more difficult for business owners, like Fried, to either reopen or keep their store open in some form, on top of challenges in their own personal lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as having children at home all day to care for.\n\"I just feel like there's so many people in our community that are balancing so much,\" said Fried. \"And I just wish I could do more to help alleviate that.\"\nEven though the future may look uncertain for many business owners, Fried is passionately mindful of\u00a0the needs of the community as a whole.\n\"I don't think people should worry about me, I think they should take care of each other,\" she said. \"And when it's done, then Dragonfly will be here for whatever things in life that they want to celebrate.\"\nThe Great Falls Area Chamber of Commerce website offers COVID-19 resources for local business owners during the pandemic .

That is under threat as the crisis cripples air travel and reduces the number of hours planes spend in the air, pushing back overhauls.\n\u201cWe foresee reduction in maintenance, repair and overhaul demand of 60% or more for commercial aero engines (in 2020). And production will fall 40-50%,\u201d said Kevin Michaels, managing director at aerospace consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\u201cWe will have an overhang of thousands and thousands of aircraft more than we require for years. To balance that out, you are going to have to retire thousands of aircraft.\u201d\nThe decline of up to 75% in services revenue, which amounts to about $60 billion in lost sales, was estimated by analyst Richard Aboulafia at aerospace consultancy Teal Group.\nLower demand for new jets is also causing the industry to revisit projections for demand for services later on, as fewer jets come down the pipeline for future parts servicing.\nThousands of layoffs are already planned or under way but some aerospace experts suggest the impact is likely to be deeper than originally thought and point to several years of hard choices, with the market properly recovering only in 2023.\nThe International Air Transport Association said last week that airlines would lose $84 billion in 2020, with revenue down by half to $419 billion, the worst year in the sector\u2019s history.\n\u201cThis is going to be a very brutal time for companies dependent upon aftermarket revenues,\u201d Aboulafia said.\n\u201cThe job cuts and spending cuts have only begun,\u201d he added. \u201cGenerally, they need to fall as closely in line with output as possible, and output - of aircraft and spare parts - has only begun to be cut too.\u201d\n(Graphic: Global commercial aviation MRO market, )\nClick here for an interactive graphic: ()\nSome 18,000 planes, or around 65% of the global fleet, were grounded throughout April and most of May and the industry is now planning for a global recession and a future where business travel is reduced and holidaymakers stay closer to home.\nEstimates collected by Reuters suggest the reduced demand will result in fewer than 20,000 planes in use in 2021 compared with an active fleet of about 27,000 planes in 2019.\nAll analysts with whom Reuters spoke said they did not expect maintenance spending to recover to 2019 levels until 2023.\nNumbers on the current age of fleets, together with indications given by some airlines, suggest between 1,500 and 2,600 aircraft could be retired over the next 12 months, more than three times as many as in a typical year.\nAt $3 million a plane, that adds up to $7.8 billion in lost aftermarket revenue. But planes over 10 years old also tend to demand more work. They make up around 48% of the current fleet, but account for more than half the maintenance, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman.

The price is the lowest since crude futures began trading in 1983 and is seconded by a drop to $10.20 in March, 1986.\nThe international marker, Brent crude, which includes June delivery, meanwhile sank 6.2 percent to $26.35 per barrel as global demand collapses by about one-third.

The agreement stipulated that 23 countries will cut a total of 9.7 million barrels a day from global markets. The oil crisis began early last month when a breakdown in negotiations with OPEC led Saudi Arabia to slash its crude export prices, causing global markets to plunge even further amid the coronavirus disruption.\nSince the beginning of the year, oil prices have dropped by more than 90 percent due to the coronavirus outbreak as well as snags in OPEC negotiations. Traders have struggled with long term storage issues in the face of lower demand, which has caused prices to drop off steeply.\nDemand for crude in the U.S. and around the globe has continued to decline as many countries remain on lockdown in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected 2.3 million people globally as of Monday afternoon and killed nearly 161,000.

Food and Agriculture Organization showed that about 3.6 million households keep cattle, contributing 40-73% of their income.\nLeonard Leakey Ritei, Kajiado County Chief Agriculture Officer, said the livestock sector supports more than 300,000 households in his county, with animals kept to pay for essentials rather than making a profit.\n\u201cOur county is predominantly a livestock area and big fractions of the population are dependent on livestock trading. For people to get food and meet other family needs, they have to sell these animals,\" he said.\nBut following Ministry of Health guidelines to control COVID-19 meant closing open-air markets, leading the county government to incur losses averaging nearly 549 million Kenyan shillings ($5 million) in revenue collection per month.\nIt is now planning a phased reopening of major livestock markets from Monday, after ensuring they can comply with coronavirus prevention protocols, Ritei added.\nThe government is also providing food aid to vulnerable residents to cushion the financial blow, he noted.\nPRICE PLUNGE\nThe pandemic is further complicating recovery from the losses communities suffered due to serious drought a year ago.\nOlankai\u2019s neighbour, cattle-keeper Moses Saninko, said he lost more than 100 cows to the drought. He worries he might not be able to afford to pay for his children's education.\n\u201cWhen the markets open, everyone will be selling their animals and the market will be flooded - hence it will be a double loss, and getting money to pay school fees will not be easy,\u201d he said.\nThe incomes of livestock-keeping communities are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic, said Ameha Sebsibe, head of livestock and fisheries at the IGAD Centre for Pastoral Areas and Livestock Development, which covers East Africa.\nSebsibe flagged the negative consequences of the pandemic for the region's market in livestock products, noting that the price of cattle, sheep and goats in Kenya's Samburu County dropped 40-60% in April from a year earlier due to low demand.\nThe IGAD centre has prepared a regional COVID-19 response plan, which it has submitted to donors, recommending the use of online marketing, easing of restrictions on animal movement, and awareness-raising on COVID-19 control for pastoralists.

Epidemiologists have warned that every human interaction increases the risk that the coronavirus spreads uncontrolled.\n\u201cEconomic statistics, at the moment, are not relevant.

Much of what\u2019s she\u2019s written about I\u2019ve covered as a journalist and an author (Donald unsuccessfully sued me for libel for my 2005 biography, TrumpNation). Everything in her book that I\u2019m familiar with is spot on. There is plenty in the book, however, that I wasn\u2019t aware of, and I suspect that\u2019s the reason the president and his siblings have gone to court to try to halt its publication. The Trumps know that Mary\u2019s understanding of her family is authentic \u2014 she\u2019s a true insider in an era when \u201cinsider\u201d accounts of the president are a dime-a-dozen \u2014 and that what she\u2019s written is likely to be indelible.The subtitle of Mary\u2019s book is \u201cHow My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man,\u201d and she makes her case diligently and chronologically.Fred Sr. was steely and unforgiving, while his wife, Mary, lived in his shadow, emotionally distant and demanding. The Queens mansion where Donald grew up as his father\u2019s favorite is an intimidating pile that Mary calls The House. In the basement of The House, Fred Sr., a teetotaler, kept an elegant bar outfitted with everything but alcohol and guarded by a collection of life-sized wooden statues of Native American chiefs standing along a wall. An oil painting of a lovely Black nightclub singer with \u201cgenerous swaying hips\u201d backed by a Black jazz band hung on a wall nearby. That was apparently as close as Fred Sr. wanted Black people to get to his family. The son of a German immigrant, he slurred any person of color seeking to rent an apartment from him as \u201cdie Schwarze.\u201d Roy Cohn, the infamous lawyer and mob confidante, came into the Trumps\u2019 lives when Fred Sr. and Donald retained him to battle a Justice Department probe of racial discrimination at Trump properties in the 1970s.Fred Sr. ruled the roost, and in Mary\u2019s view he did so as a sociopath, driving her father to ruin and forcing her Uncle Donald to adapt to his binary, winner-take-all view of the world. Losing was unacceptable, and the power of positive thinking was everything. \u201cJust give it a quarter of a turn on the mental carburetor,\u201d Fred Sr. advised Fred Jr. as the way to conquer alcoholism. Mary writes that after Fred Jr. died, the Trumps apparently schemed to disinherit her and her brother, cutting off their health insurance when they wouldn\u2019t play along.Donald, more than any of his four siblings, reveled in Fred Sr.\u2019s hothouse. He stole one of his brother\u2019s trucks as a child just so he could see how anguished his brother might become. He bucked authority as a teenager, prompting his parents to send him to military school. According to Mary, he paid someone to take the SAT exams for him so he could get into a better college. When Fred Sr. slipped into dementia soon before dying, Donald, strapped for cash, maneuvered unsuccessfully to push his siblings aside and gain control of an estate worth several hundred million dollars. Although Donald\u2019s entire career was built on Fred Sr.\u2019s wealth and connections, Donald treated his father dismissively in his final years. Then again, Fred Sr. treated most people dismissively, and Donald is what Mary describes as a \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s monster,\u201d shaped by his father\u2019s pathologies. Fred Sr. lacked the marketing savvy and media know-how of his son, so he helped push Donald into the spotlight and risked the family fortune along the way so he could bask in his son\u2019s glory. Donald thrived on the attention and took advantage of the license afforded by his father\u2019s wealth, eventually adopting \u201ccheating as a way of life.\u201d Mary takes the media to task for searching for a \u201cstrategy\u201d in anything Donald does and for soft-pedaling what she describes as multiple psychological disorders, which, by her account, check a variety of boxes in diagnostic manuals. She thinks that Donald, at a minimum, suffers from an \u201cantisocial personality disorder\u201d and a longstanding but undiagnosed learning disability.\n\u201cThe fact is, Donald\u2019s pathologies are so complex and his behaviors so often inexplicable that coming up with an accurate and comprehensive diagnosis would require a full battery of psychological and neuropsychological tests that he\u2019ll never sit for,\u201d she writes.\nMary\u2019s understanding of her family was also shaped by reporting in the New York Times. A landmark expose the Times published in 2018 about the Trump family\u2019s tax dodging and financial chicanery relied on her as a key source. She provided the paper with pivotal documentation that showed how the Trumps used a shell company to skim millions from the family business to avoid estate and income taxes. It was the Times\u2019s forensic work, using her documentation, that revealed the skimming to her and to readers \u2013 and also made her realize that her aunts and uncles had most likely been cheating her out of significant sums of money as well.\nFor all of that, the tone of Mary\u2019s book isn\u2019t bitter. She maintains a sense of humor about some of the absurdities she\u2019s encountered (Donald was slow to pay her when she helped ghostwrite one of his books) and is forgiving, to a point, about the myriad shortcomings of her various relatives. But she is clearly disappointed. The book is ultimately a melancholy account of aunts and uncles who openly disdain Donald but are afraid to get in his way. The book quotes Donald\u2019s eldest sister, Maryanne, a former federal judge, saying that Donald \u201chas no principles. None!\u201d Maryanne is also quoted dismissing the possibility that her brother will be elected president: \u201cHe\u2019s a clown \u2014 this will never happen.\u201d The fact that Donald was elected also informs the book\u2019s melancholy, with Mary stunned that tens of millions of voters were capable of embracing or overlooking her uncle\u2019s \u201cblatant racism\u201d and his \u201ccasual dehumanization of people.\u201d\nOther observers have picked up on some of this over the years, of course. Liz Smith, the late New York gossip columnist, had a street-smart understanding of Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s something about him that\u2019s ever juvenile. It\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s a grown-up person who went to college,\u201d she once told me. \u201cHe\u2019s like a kid, and he\u2019s got that brash, narcissistic thing that works for him. He has enormous appeal to the masses because of that.\u201d\nBut Mary understands that\u2019s not a benign matter anymore. \u201cDonald today is much as he was at three years old: incapable of growing, learning or evolving, unable to regulate his emotions, moderate his responses, or take in and synthesize information,\u201d she writes. \u201cThis is far beyond garden-variety narcissism; Donald is not simply weak, his ego is a fragile thing that must be bolstered every moment because he knows deep down that he is nothing of what he claims to be. He knows he has never been loved.\u201d\nWrit large \u2014 on an international stage amid a pandemic and social upheaval, and with the powers of the presidency at Donald\u2019s disposal \u2014 those resentments metastasize into something wildly menacing.\n\u201cHe has suffered mightily,\u201d Mary writes of Donald\u2019s worldview, \u201cand if you aren\u2019t doing all you can to alleviate that suffering, you should suffer too.\u201d\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTimothy L.

The White House based its decision on a series of misleading statements issued by the WHO, as well as on director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus\u2019s effusive praise of the Chinese government. (Not coincidentally, China backed Tedros\u2019s bid to lead the organization in 2017.)\nCritics charge Trump with scapegoating the WHO for the administration\u2019s failures, while others caution that pulling funding will weaken efforts to combat the pandemic. They are wrong on both counts.\nIt\u2019s no secret that the White House got off to a late start in combating the coronavirus. Trump downplayed the threat of the disease even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to brace for an outbreak, and we criticized him for it. But this obviously doesn\u2019t vindicate the World Health Organization. We noted its failures last week .\nTedros objected to Trump\u2019s correct decision to impose travel restrictions on China, claiming it would \u201chave the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit\u201d \u2014 a stark contrast with his deferential statements about China\u2019s response. In mid January, the WHO announced that there was \u201cno clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus,\u201d despite numerous reports to the contrary . Parroting Chinese misinformation wasn\u2019t enough for Tedros: He went on to praise the Chinese Communist Party for \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control.\u201d Later, Tedros overruled the objections of WHO colleagues and delayed the declaration of a public-health emergency, which cost the world precious time in preparing for the pandemic.\nBecause there are no existing vaccines or proven treatments for COVID-19, information is our most valuable resource in fighting this pandemic. Policymakers must calibrate their responses based on data collected domestically and received from abroad. In its capacity as the facilitator of international information exchanges, the WHO is supposed to vet and disseminate data from its 194 member states. The organization fell down on this most basic task by buying Chinese spin wholesale.\nSome argue that withholding our funding of the WHO \u2014 $400 million a year \u2014 will hinder its international relief efforts. This is a legitimate concern, but the WHO\u2019s missteps themselves hindered the fight against the pandemic at a critical stage. In any event, U.S. funding of pandemic relief does not depend on any single multilateral bureaucracy. In fact, the U.S. has already spent more than $500 million on foreign aid to combat the pandemic \u2014 roughly 25 percent of the WHO\u2019s annual budget \u2014 on top of existing contributions to multilateral and nongovernmental organizations. During the 60-day hold on funds to the WHO, the White House says it will redirect resources to public-health programs untainted by Chinese influence. While the White House conducts its investigation, the WHO will retain the bulk of its considerable resources. In the meantime, it will deservedly face more international scrutiny for its apparent complicity in China\u2019s coverup of the coronavirus.\nThe more the World Health Organization capitulates to Chinese soft power, the less effective \u2014 and the less deserving of our support \u2014 it will be.

He said this year will at least match that tally, noting a $200 billion increase in equity supply in the first five months of 2020.\nGlobal net equity issuance\n\u201cThe virus situation is creating a backlog of pending equity issuance. There is a need to raise equity, and the equity market rally suggests that there is likely to be more appetite from the private sector to inject capital,\u201d he said.\nIn contrast, Panigirtzoglou predicts that global share buybacks this year may amount to $450 billion, halving from 2019 levels.\nUp until now, the popularity of buybacks among U.S. companies helped to cut the share count on the S&P 500 index by around 25 billion between mid-2011 and end-2019, based on data from the Yardeni Research consultancy.\nDwindling equity supply\nThis year though, Goldman Sachs predicts that U.S. buybacks will halve from 2019 levels to around $370 billion. And the record $60 billion raised on U.S. equity markets last month, shows companies are on a share-selling spree.\nThe turnaround has only just begun, said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS in Boston.\n\u201cMarkets are under-estimating the reversal of what we saw in the past 10 years,\u201d Almeida said. \u201cThe capability of businesses to leverage balance sheets further and buy back stocks in an environment where they have furloughed employees is going to be pretty low.\u201d\nS&P 500 buybacks and dividends\nYears of shrinking equity supply -- dubbed de-equitisation -- meant more money was chasing each share, which helped to drive the equity market boom. Almeida said S&P 500-listed corporations purchased more than $4 trillion of stock since 2010, making them the biggest equity buyer by a factor of two.\nMany analysts believe a shift towards increased equity supply will be a drag on markets and increase volatility if companies no longer buy shares when their stocks tumble.\nBuybacks also helped to boost earnings. Richard Saldanha, a portfolio manager at Aviva Investors, estimates they contributed roughly 2% a year to earnings-per-share growth at S&P 500 companies. But he sees the shift as a longer-term positive if it means an increase in capital expenditure.\n\u201cAs the buyback component gets reduced, companies can deploy capital into supply chains, automation, R&D ... This will be one of the lasting consequences from this crisis,\u201d Saldanha predicted.\nIn 2018, companies\u2019 capex grew a meagre 2% worldwide, after almost a decade of central bank stimulus, S&P Global said. The proportion of cash used for capex versus dividends, buybacks, acquisitions and R&D was at its lowest in more than a decade.\nBut the shift away from buybacks has not yet upset stock markets, which have several other sources of support. For one, companies are far less capital-intensive than in the past so will not need to issue huge amounts of equity.\nAnd equities will look attractive as an asset class given that equity risk premia -- essentially stocks\u2019 excess future return over bonds -- are well above long-term averages.\nJPM\u2019s Panigirtzoglou highlighted \u201ca structural change in the liquidity and interest rate environment\u201d that will favour equities.\nBuybacks may come back into fashion but in the aftermath of the crisis companies will find it tough to justify borrowing money to buy their own shares or pay dividends.\nBofA\u2019s latest fund manager survey found just 7% of investors favour buybacks, while 73% preferred to see a reduction in debt.\nInstead, investors say they will focus more on the cash and debt levels on corporate balance sheets, as well as paying more attention to employee working conditions and environmental impact.\nMatthew Jennings, investment director at Fidelity International, said Fidelity fund managers were avoiding companies that were \u201cover-distributing\u201d even before the crisis because these would be more likely to cut dividends suddenly or tap shareholders for emergency cash.\n\u201cShareholders will look for companies to fund dividends and buybacks through profits rather than debt,\u201d Jennings added. \u201cMany companies will have to rebuild balance sheets and deleverage before they can do that.\u201d\nS&P 500 buybacks peaked in Q4 2018\nReporting by Sujata Rao; graphics by Ritvik Carvalho.

While the unemployment rate fell below 10%, it was biased down by a continuing misclassification problem.\nThe slowdown pressures the White House and Congress to restart stalled negotiations for another fiscal package and is likely to become political ammunition for both Democrats and Republicans with just two months to go until the presidential election.\n\u201cThe labor market has entered a frustratingly slower second phase of the recovery,\u201d said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \u201cWith one in two laid-off workers still unemployed and Congress unable to pass urgently needed fiscal aid, slower and more volatile job growth represents a significant risk for the economy.\u201d\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 1.371 million jobs last month after advancing 1.734 million in July. Government employment rose 344,000, with 238,000 temporary workers hired for the decennial census.\nExcluding government, payrolls rose 1.027 million. Private sector employment gains were led by the retail sector, with 249,000 jobs created. Though professional and business services added 197,000 jobs, more than half of the gain was in temporary help services, reflecting the uncertain economic environment.\nEmployment in leisure and hospitality increased by 174,000 jobs, but hiring has stepped down from June and July when 2.0 million and 621,000 jobs were added respectively. Manufacturing employment rose 29,000 and construction added 16,000 jobs.\nPrograms to help businesses pay wages have either lapsed or are on the verge of ending.

Employment growth peaked at 4.781 million.\nWhile the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month from 10.2% in July, it was distorted by people misclassifying themselves as being \u201cemployed but absent from work.\u201d\nWithout this error, the unemployment rate would have been about 9.1% last month, the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated. At least 29.2 million were receiving unemployment benefits in mid-August.\nBlacks continued to experience high unemployment, with a 13% jobless rate compared to 7.3% for Whites and 10.5% for Hispanics.\nPeople who have permanently lost their jobs rose 534,000 to 3.4 million, accounting for 25% of the 13.6 million unemployed.\n\u201cThis is a somewhat concerning sign of labor market sclerosis developing,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan in New York.\nStocks on Wall Street were lower as technology shares slumped. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies.

The public health emergency has prompted the temporary closure of most hospital outpatient clinics.\n\"Given the current pandemic, this is game-changing for these transplant patients and it helps reduce their risk of possible COVID-19 infection.

These immunosuppressant drugs can be toxic to the body and blood levels must be carefully monitored.\nLevels for immunosuppressant drugs like tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus and Cyclosporin A, are normally measured in whole blood following venipuncture performed at a clinic. Patients on these medications are at much greater risk of COVID-19 and stay-at-home instructions complicates the process of blood draw at the hospital, according to Setchell.\nSetchell and his team in the Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine worked around this problem in a matter of weeks by developing new clinical assays to measure immunosuppressant levels from a dried blood spot on a piece of paper.\nA kit is mailed to the patient, who is instructed to prick a finger and spot the blood onto a paper card, let it dry and then place it in an envelope that is mailed back to the Clinical Mass Spectrometry laboratory at Cincinnati Children's. After the sample arrives at the lab, a circular disc is punched out of the blood spot and the immunosuppressant is extracted and analyzed by high resolution tandem mass spectrometry to determine the drug concentration.\nSetchell said the mail-in test provides comparable blood concentrations as whole blood, is very convenient, and has a rapid turnaround time. This allows clinicians to determine appropriate dosing of immunosuppressant levels.\nThe test was developed in collaboration with Thomas Ryan , MD, and the Heart Transplant Team at Cincinnati Children's. Setchell and his team include Junfang Zhao , Rong Huang, Wujuan Zhang, Xeuheng Zhao and Stephanie Galandi.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/covid-19-prompts-new-home-test-for-kids-with-organ-transplants-301058255.html\nSOURCE Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"}, {"RECORDID": "20200923-46386", "label": 0, "title": "Election 101 podcast: The basics of voting by mail", "body": "The \"I Voted\" sticker may look the same, but make no mistake: in 2020, voting will look very different.

Depending on their state, some will opt for early voting, casting their ballots at polling places in the weeks ahead of the election, but many others will vote by mail.\n\n\nVoting by mail isn't new.\nAccording to Patrick, Americans have been casting their vote through the Postal Service since the Civil War, when President Abraham Lincoln wanted to ensure that soldiers who were away from home still had the ability to vote in the election.\nVideo: Keilar to Trump official: Where is Trump's health care plan?

Voters in some states automatically get mailed a ballot, and voters in other states need to apply for a mail-in ballot. Check each state's rules here.\n\nFirst, make sure you request your ballot early -- many states have a deadline for requesting ballots to ensure they arrive on time. And if Election Day is drawing near and you still haven't received your ballot, check in with your local board of elections. Look up state-by-state rules using CNN's voter guide .\nPatrick points out that in some states you can even request a ballot up to the day before the election.\nThen, double-check the rules about how to fill out the ballot.\n\"[One reason] that ballots get rejected is because of a lack of signature or the signature that doesn't match. That's where you just want to make sure that you sign it where you need to,\" says Patrick. Some states even require the signature of a witness.\nMail-in ballots can typically be returned to local officials and dropboxes as well as by mail. Traditionally, the US Postal Service has recommended you mail your ballot at least a week before the election.\nAnd that's it. Request your ballot early. Read the submission instructions closely.

But when those measures come to an end, many companies may not survive, he explained.\n\"If a lot of companies are not able to survive ... you'll have this million-dollar question of how do you deal with these 'zombie companies,'\" said the CEO.\n\"Do you keep putting money ... using public finances to support companies or do you let creative destruction happen a la Schumpeter? This is going to be a real challenge particularly in the SME space around the world, I suspect this will be a big, big challenge next year,\" he added.\nGupta was referring to a concept popularized by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, which describes the process of dismantling the old to make way for the new and improved.\nThe CEO said politics and civil society would make it difficult for governments to continue supporting those businesses financially for long periods. That \"means that you'll start seeing a lot more default, which in turn means that you'll start seeing the problems spill over to the financial sector,\" he explained.\nFor banks, there would be \"far more damage\" to their balance sheets, said Gupta. But banks globally have also entered the current pandemic-induced crisis on stronger footing and can take on \"a lot more pain\" compared to the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, he added.\nIn Singapore, where DBS is based, the government has projected an economic contraction of between 4% and 7% this year \u2014 which would be the country's worst downturn since its independence in 1965.\nAuthorities have introduced measures to help households and businesses, including allowing them to defer some of their loan repayments until the end of this year.\nThe city-state's financial regulator and central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said last week that nearly 34,000 mortgages now enjoy deferment of principal or interest payments or both. It added that more than 5,300 small- and medium-sized enterprises have deferred repayments on secured loans.\nRavi Menon, managing director of the MAS, said the relief measures will \"see us through the worst part of the crisis\" but they cannot go on forever. He explained that the accumulation of debt could increase the risk of default \"further down the road.\"\nGupta said DBS \u2014 the largest bank in Southeast Asia \u2014 has taken \"some fairly draconian assumptions around the number of SMEs that are likely to be unable to survive\" in its internal stress testing. He warned that the ratio of bad loans could be worse than the level seen during the global financial crisis.\n\"I think you will see more stress on the financial system in the later part of this year and next year without a doubt. And that's just because the fallout of the macroeconomic shock has still to filter through the financial system at this point in time, I think it will come,\" he said.\nThat, coupled with a low interest rate environment, is compounding the challenges banks face. But the CEO reiterated that the bank has beefed up its buffers in anticipation of the potential loan losses. While he's open to potentially cutting dividends, he said DBS has a robust enough capital base to \"not have to go there\" yet.\n\"If we voluntarily cut dividend, I think it'll be a fair bet to say that we think the outlook is grimmer than we had originally anticipated,\" added Gupta."}, {"RECORDID": "20200723-21335", "label": -1, "title": "China warns it 'must' retaliate after closure of Houston consulate | Reuters", "body": "By Huizhong Wu , David Brunnstrom\n5 Min Read\nBEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China said the U.S. move to close its Houston consulate this week had \u201cseverely harmed\u201d relations and warned it \u201cmust\u201d retaliate, without detailing what it would do.\nWashington on Tuesday gave China 72 hours to close the consulate, which it said was \u201cto protect American intellectual property and Americans\u2019 private information,\u201d a dramatic escalation of tension between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin described the U.S. allegations as \u201cmalicious slander\u201d and said the \u201cunreasonable\u201d move had \u201cseverely harmed\u201d relations.\n\u201cChina must make a necessary response and safeguard its legitimate rights,\u201d he said, declining to specify any measures.\nThe South China Morning Post reported that China may close the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, while a source told Reuters on Wednesday that China was considering shutting the consulate in Wuhan, where the United States withdrew staff at the start of the coronavirus outbreak.\nHu Xijin, editor of China\u2019s Global Times tabloid, posted on Twitter: \u201cBased on what I know, China will announce countermeasure on Friday Beijing time.

The person had underlying health problems and likely had been exposed on a cruise ship voyage between San Francisco and Mexico last month.\nIt was the first coronavirus fatality in the United States outside of Washington state, where 10 people have died in a cluster of at least 39 infections that have emerged through community transmission of the virus in two Seattle-area counties.\nAlthough the Placer County patient who died was not believed to have contracted the virus locally, that case and a previous one from the San Francisco Bay Area linked to the same ocean liner have led health authorities to seek other cruise passengers who may have had close contact with those two individuals.\nHours after the person\u2019s death was announced, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency in response to the coronavirus, which he said has resulted in 53 cases across the nation\u2019s most populous state.\n\u201cThe State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.\nNewsom said the cruise ship, named the Grand Princess, had later sailed on to Hawaii and was returning to San Francisco, but would not be allowed into port until passengers had been tested for the virus.\n\u201cWe are holding that ship off the coast,\u201d Newsom said.\nSix new coronavirus patients were confirmed in Los Angeles County, public health officials said on Wednesday. One was a federal contractor who may have been exposed while conducting medical screenings at Los Angeles International Airport, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported.\nThree others likely were infected while traveling recently to northern Italy, one of the areas hardest hit in the global outbreak. Of the six in Los Angeles County, only one has been hospitalized. The other five are recovering in home isolation.\nThe greater Seattle region represents the biggest concentration of cases detected in the United States from a virus that has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, mostly in China, where the epidemic originated in December.\nWith most of the Seattle-area cases not linked to travel or exposure to people who might have been infected abroad, that means the virus has gone from being an imported phenomenon to taking up residence in Washington state, health officials say.\nAt least 18 cases, including six deaths, were connected to a long-term nursing facility for the elderly, called LifeCare Center of Kirkland, in a Seattle suburb.\n\u2018DISTANCING MEASURES\u2019\nSeattle health authorities urged a number of measures for curbing further spread of the disease, including recommendations for anyone aged 60 and older and individuals with underlying chronic health problems or compromised immunity to stay home and away from large gatherings and public places.\nThey also urged companies to allow their employees to work from home as much as possible, stagger shifts to ease commuter congestion on public transportation and avoid large work-related gatherings.\n\u201cThe distancing measures that we\u2019re recommending are essential because we need to slow the spread of the disease to the point where we are able to continue to handle the load,\u201d said Patty Hayes, the public health director for Seattle and King County.\nA growing number of U.S. companies are adopting such steps.

Many airports are also requiring face coverings. Major U.S. airlines have also endorsed temperature checks at airports by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, which so far has implemented safety measures such as increased spacing in security checkpoint queues.\nThe European Commission last week proposed airlines and airports require passengers to wear masks, and reorganise check-ins, dropoffs and luggage pickups to avoid crowds. Travellers should keep luggage and movement in the cabin to a minimum. The guidelines are not binding, but they may help form a framework in the bloc as restrictions are lifted. The United Kingdom is observing E.U. trade and travel regulations until the end of 2020.\nThe aviation regulator is requiring extra ventilation and sterilisation of airplanes and airports. Passengers are required to fill out an electronic health declaration before boarding and are asked to sit apart from each other onboard if possible. Temperature checks are required for every passenger and workers like cabin crew and security officers are offered protective gear. Passengers need to wear a mask throughout the flight.\nThe government has directed airlines to make in-flight announcements about health measures and to distribute health information cards and questionnaires. It has also asked airport staff to wear masks, but they are not mandatory for passengers. There is no requirement to keep the middle seat empty.\nThe aviation regulator is requiring travellers' temperatures be checked in the airport. Airport authorities ask travellers to stand at least 1 metre (3 ft) apart in line, and are furnished with hand sanitiser. Korean Air Lines Co Ltd 003490.KS is seating passengers as far apart as possible, conducting additional temperature checks on international travellers and requiring all domestic passengers to wear masks, with a few exceptions such as children under 2 years.\nAt the airport, staff and passengers are required to pass temperature checks and disinfection procedures, with high contact areas disinfected every 10 to 15 minutes.

Wintrust has since notified and is working with those clients who didn\u2019t receive loan authorization, mainly due to incomplete or ineligible applications, to help review other sources of relief that may be available to them.\nHistorically, Wintrust ranks as one of the largest SBA lenders in the communities it serves. For the PPP program, Wintrust secured approval of more than $2.5 billion in loans for approximately 7,500 small businesses in Illinois. It secured approval of over $263 million in loans for more than 850 small businesses in Wisconsin. The remaining approximately $500 million in loan approvals were secured for more than 500 small business borrowers with operations in other states around the country. The median loan size is approximately $87,500, and more than 4,500 loans, over half of the total number of PPP loans made by Wintrust, are for less than $100,000, demonstrating the relief provided by Wintrust community banks to very small businesses.\nEdward J. Wehmer, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cOur clients and communities needed our help and we did our very best to earn the trust they placed in us. We have begun funding the loan applications that we received during the early days of the program, thus far funding nearly half of the $3.3 billion in approved loans. We look forward to completing the necessary documentation and funding the remaining loans as quickly as possible over the next few days.\u201d\nWehmer continued, \u201cThese are difficult times for everyone. And while we could have never envisioned these specific circumstances when Wintrust was founded in 1991, one of our founding principles was to always answer the call of our communities when the time came and that is what we continue to strive to do. I hope that through our unprecedented efforts to fully engage as a PPP lender, we have been able to provide some peace of mind and comfort to participating small business owners and their employees for the coming months, and allow those small businesses that otherwise might have been forced to close the opportunity to re-open and hopefully flourish.\u201d\nTom Huffman, Senior Vice President, Wintrust SBA Lending, stated, \u201cIn a little under two weeks, Wintrust administered nearly 50 times the number of SBA loan applications through the PPP program than we process in a typical year. Wintrust saw the reports that the $349 billion was close to being exhausted earlier this week. We made every effort, through around-the-clock work for days, to secure authorizations for the inquiries that were properly submitted. There are now reports that Congress may make a second appropriation for the PPP program. If that happens, we will be ready to serve our communities once again.\u201d\nAt this point, the SBA is no longer accepting applications for the PPP, and accordingly, Wintrust is not accepting PPP applications at this time. Wintrust encourages those who did not apply for the PPP, but may want to if additional funding is appropriated, to watch wintrust.com and the SBA website for further developments. Wintrust would also urge small businesses in need to investigate other potential funding options, via the SBA or other government agencies who may have a program for which they qualify.\nWehmer concluded, \u201cI again want to thank the entire Wintrust team for their momentous efforts. It was amazing to witness the challenges they overcame and accomplishments they achieved to serve our clients and communities.\u201d\nFor additional and current information on how Wintrust and its affiliate charter banks are responding to the coronavirus click here .\nAbout Wintrust Wintrust is a financial holding company with assets of over $36 billion whose common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

That\u2019s because the panel\u2019s new projection for Road Fund revenues amounted to a larger percentage drop. The revised forecast will cause cuts of about $161 million from the Road Fund.\nEarlier: Kentucky General Assembly passes one-year state budget, despite near-empty House chamber\nCOVID-19: New state revenue forecast projects dramatic budget shortfalls in Kentucky\nBeshear said he\u2019s talked with legislative leaders about what he hopes can be a \u201cshort, targeted\u201d special session.

Without another round of federal aid, the cuts will be significant, Beshear said.\nThe Consensus Forecasting Group on Friday offered a pessimistic outlook for the state\u2019s short-term revenue collections as the battered economy tries to bounce back from the the global pandemic.\nMore: How prepared are Kentucky hospitals for a second wave of the coronavirus?\nSee this: Everything\u00a0to know about coronavirus outbreaks in Kentucky nursing homes\nThe panel agreed to a revised forecast of just under $11 billion in General Fund revenues this fiscal year. That projection necessitates the budget cuts of about $457 million. It reviewed such variables as consumer spending, unemployment, manufacturing and personal income in revising its forecast.\nLast month, state budget director John Hicks warned of a potential General Fund shortfall of $318.7 to $495.7 million this fiscal year. Tax collections took a nosedive in April as businesses closed or scaled back amid the virus outbreak. The state\u2019s unemployment rate has surged since the virus hit.\nBeshear is gradually reopening the state\u2019s economy, coupled with health guidelines meant to prevent the virus from spreading.\nThe panel on Friday didn\u2019t take up any new revenue forecasts for the next fiscal year, but it could be asked to do so in coming months. Beshear said it\u2019s premature to do so right now.\n\u201cI do believe our economy is going to bounce back, though it\u2019s going to take a little time to bounce back in the way that we want it to, depending on what happens with this virus,\u201d he said.\nEarlier this year, Kentucky lawmakers passed a slimmed-down, one-year state budget for the fiscal year starting July 1.

Why?", "body": "A friend of mine, another journalist, texts me every few days with the latest coronavirus case and death counts from Singapore. On Monday: \u201cSingapore is now at 28k cases and 22 deaths.\u201d I checked the Johns Hopkins dashboard on Wednesday morning to confirm: 29,364 confirmed Covid-19 cases and still just 22 deaths.\nAll of us are amateur epidemiologists now, and my friend\u2019s fascination with Singapore is all about the country\u2019s remarkably low case fatality rate. Based on those numbers, just 0.07 percent of people in Singapore who contracted the coronavirus have died from it. Compare that to the United States, where more than 6 percent of confirmed Covid-19 cases have resulted in death.\nTo look at it a different way, this chart compares total Covid-19 deaths per million people in both countries:\n      \u00a9 Our World In Data   The US is trying to bend the curve. Singapore doesn\u2019t even have a curve to speak of. What\u2019s going on?\nFor starters, to return to my friend\u2019s obsession with case fatality rates, those are a very crude metric. They are extremely vulnerable to variations in testing, because the denominators in this equation are confirmed cases \u2014 i.e. positive tests. The US and Singapore are interesting examples that show this metric\u2019s usefulness and its limitations.\nVideo: Meet the robot dog promoting safe distancing in Singapore's parks (The Boston Globe)\n\n____________________________________________________\nMore on coronavirus: \nDownload the Microsoft News app for full coverage of the crisis\nLockdown laws: What has changed? (PA)\nHow to stay safe working, travelling and shopping (Sky News)\n____________________________________________________\nConversely, Singapore\u2019s case fatality rate may be so low because it is testing a lot of people with mild or no symptoms.\nThe country has escalated its testing because of Covid-19 outbreaks in the dormitories that house many of Singapore\u2019s low-wage migrant workers. You may recall that, by late March, the island seemed to have Covid-19 under control. Leaning on the lessons from the SARS outbreak in 2003, the country implemented a rapid testing-and-tracing program, as well as restricting travel into Singapore and requiring self-quarantines.\nBut then cases started to rise again \u2014 almost entirely because of infections among migrant workers, who live together in tightly packed dormitories on the edge of the city. As the second wave began to crest in Singapore in mid-April, about 90 percent of the new cases turned out to be foreign workers who were living in the dorms.\nSo Singapore implemented a new screening program with the goal of testing effectively every single worker living in those facilities. It is testing thousands of workers every day, whether or not they show any Covid-19 symptoms.\nThese people are generally young; they\u2019ve come to Singapore to work on construction projects or in manufacturing or in the health care sector. And we know the Covid-19 fatality rates among younger people are much lower in general than among seniors.\nSo if you want to understand why the case fatality rate is so stubbornly low in Singapore, part of it is a matter of chance: The groups of people who got sick were at a lower risk of dying. But equally \u2014 if not more \u2014 important is the prevalence of testing and the country\u2019s focus on testing these younger and sometimes asymptomatic people.\n\u201cThis programme likely detected cases that would otherwise not have presented to healthcare centres for diagnosis,\u201d Ooi Eng Eong, deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Program at the Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School, told me over email.\nThat inflates the total number of cases, the denominator used to calculate the case fatality rate. Singapore\u2019s testing skews younger because of the emphasis on the migrant dorms, and the country appears to have mostly avoided Covid-19 outbreaks in its nursing homes where more vulnerable elderly people live.\n\u201cWhile the screening programme led to more cases being reported than if case detection was limited to those that fit the COVID-19 case definition, it also expanded the denominator in the mortality rate calculation: the number of fatal cases divided by total number of cases,\u201d he said.\nSo now you might be asking why there was an outbreak in these migrant worker dormitories. It seems to have been a bit of random chance. The New York Times reported that government officials thought somebody might have picked up the virus at a nearby shopping mall favored by migrant workers. Or they may have been infected at a construction site linked to a small cluster of cases. Or both.\nGallery: How the coronavirus is being handled globally (Photo Services)\n\nThis cascade of unpredictable events reminded me of a post that my colleague Brian Resnick put up Wednesday morning, on chaos theory and the inherent uncertainty of a pandemic:\nThere\u2019s a simple mechanical that is helping me understand the many possible futures we face with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIt\u2019s the double pendulum, and as a physical object, it\u2019s very simple: A pendulum (a string and a weight) is attached to the bottom of another. Its movement is explained by the laws of motion written by Isaac Newton hundreds of years ago.\nBut slight changes in the initial condition of the pendulum \u2014 say it starts its swing from a little higher up, or if the weight of the pendulum balls is a little heavier, or one of the pendulum arms is a bit longer than the other \u2014 lead to wildly different outcomes that are very hard to predict.\nAs Brian points out, the coronavirus pandemic is even more complicated than the double-pendulum model. It makes the future very difficult to predict.\nIt\u2019s a complicated recipe and it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, to isolate one ingredient that explains why the death rate in the US is so much worse than it is in Singapore.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we know nothing. And the Singapore example does conform to certain expectations we already have for the disease.\nSingapore can be thankful that its worst outbreaks have been in dorms full of young workers instead of nursing homes, as we\u2019ve seen in the United States and Europe. Some credit is also certainly due to the testing-and-tracing programs, the travel restrictions, and Singapore\u2019s strong health care system (disparities for migrant workers notwithstanding).\nSome of these things could be applicable in America: The country could do better testing and tracing, and it could build a stronger health system. The US does have a relatively young population compared to other countries and so more testing could potentially reveal a more widespread outbreak \u2014 and, paradoxically, a lower death rate \u2014 than the current data suggests.\nBut the coronavirus has already infiltrated nursing homes in the US. It is little comfort to seniors and their families, nor to younger people who have gotten very sick or died, to know that the fatality rate may be closer to 1 percent (or lower) than 6 percent if only we tested younger people and found people who have been infected but have no symptoms or mild ones. Bad luck and a poor initial response have already distinguished America\u2019s outbreak from the one in Singapore.\nEvery country\u2019s coronavirus experience is a reflection of factors both within its control and then chaos and random luck that nobody, not even Singapore, can control. The same is true of every individual\u2019s risk, a convoluted mess of their race, age, economic status, preexisting medical conditions, and biology that science is only beginning to understand.\nI do plan to send this article to my friend. I hope it provides some insights into his question. But I don\u2019t expect it to be entirely satisfactory either. There is simply too much uncertainty for that.\nStay at home as much as possible to stop coronavirus spreading - here is the latest government guidance .

In my opinion, Chevron stock could be headed back to $53.\nAt the moment, the world is producing far too much oil. On top of that, we\u2019re running out of places to store it. It\u2019s so bad some tankers are storing global oil supply at sea. Even OPEC has said \u201cFor oil markets, the massive oil-demand contraction is unprecedented. The current outlook looks extremely bleak, with oil markets anticipated to be severely tested on many fronts.\u201d\nOPEC Secretary General Barkindo added, \u201cThe oversupply would add a further 1.3 billion barrels to global oil stocks, thereby exhausting available global crude storage capacity by May.\u201d That alone could pressure oil well below $20 a barrel. Worse, \u201cAlready, ports and refiners are turning away oil tankers. This will put even more downward pressure on prices and pose an existential threat to many companies,\u201d analysts at the Eurasia Group said.\nAlso, OPEC may have cut production by the biggest amount in history. \u00a0Unfortunately, without sizable demand, oil prices could easily head lower. \u00a0Worse, OPEC is forecasting crude demand to fall by 6.8 million barrels a day in 2020. \u00a0\u201cEven if OPEC members fully implement their share of the agreed cutbacks \u2014 a fragile assumption, given that many tend to cheat \u2014 they\u2019d still be producing more than the market requires in the second quarter,\u201d reports Bloomberg contributor Grant Smith.\nRussia and the Saudis put the oil price war to bed. Unfortunately, the anticipation of the supply deal was far greater than what we ended up with. The two countries just agreed to cap production to 8.5 MM barrels per day for May and June 2020. OPEC+ will seek an additional cut of five million barrels a day from the G-20 meeting.\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not enough to balance out a market crippled by demand shortfalls. Worse, the market is far from impressed by the latest announcements. Goldman Sachs even says oil may be headed back to $10 a barrel on the imbalance.\n\u201cOur updated 2020 global oil balance suggests that a 10 mb/d headline cut (for an effective 6.5 mb/d cut in production) would not be sufficient, still requiring an additional 4 mb/d of necessary price induced shut-ins. While this argues for a larger headline cut of close to 15 mb/d, we believe this would be much harder to achieve, since the incremental burden would likely need to fall on Saudi Arabia to be effective,\u201d says Goldman Sachs.\nSuch news is crippling Chevron stock, which was down as much as $3.50 on the day. Exxon Mobil just pulled back $1.50, with BP (NYSE: BP ) falling $1. In short, it\u2019s just not enough of a cut to balance the market, and send markets higher.\nWith far too much supply in the world, OPEC being stubborn, and not enough demand, oil prices could easily pull back to $10 a barrel. We may have to wait for the coronavirus scare to end, and for demand to naturally return before we see oil back above $20 a barrel.\nRight now, avoid oil stocks like Chevron.

New orders for U.S.-made capital goods rebounded more than expected in May, but recouped only a portion of the prior two months' declines.

A dispute between the United States and the European Union, in which Washington is flagging possible changes in tariffs on EU goods, also hurt risk sentiment. The euro slipped as riskier assets in the region, including Italian bonds, weakened, and as the European Central Bank fought back against a German court challenge to its money-printing plans. \"There\u2019s a little bit of unease going on in the European financial markets, which is probably weighing on the euro,\" said Nelson.

They reflected a mix of existing and new problem loans for mid-sized and large customers, ING said.\nSome 206 million euros in provisions stemmed from generally worsening economic conditions while 41 million euros in provisions on its U.S. loan book were linked to falling oil prices.\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly affecting society and the economy throughout the world, and it will continue to do so for some time,\u201d CEO Ralph Hamers said.\nING shares were up 5.9% to 5.18 euros by 0725 GMT yet still down more than 50% year to date.\nThe bank said gross results improved at its large retail banking businesses in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, while its wholesale banking business saw a sharp decline due to the provisions.\nLending grew by 14.8 billion euros to 626 billion euros in the quarter, including 5.6 billion euros of loans generated under crisis programs underwritten in part by governments.\nHamers said that loan growth also reflected businesses drawing on credit facilities which were then deposited at ING.

Despite what you hear from politicians from both parties, there's actually not much we can say for certain about which policies performed better than others - yet. But one thing is clear: Most states need better plans to guide their responses to pandemics and other emergencies.\nGovernors across the nation embarked on significantly different approaches to tackling COVID-19. Some states quarantined travelers; others did not. Some limited social gatherings to 10, some to 25, and others to 50 or even more. Face mask requirements are statewide in some places, applied at the city or county level elsewhere, and completely absent from yet other states. School reopening plans are just as varied.\nThese differences suggest that states did not develop, or did not follow, prepared plans. They winged it, in other words. This does not mean governors acted arbitrarily or failed to consider expert opinion or evidence when making decisions - just that these decisions were not made according to a strategy that had been prepared in advance.\nIf states had prepared and followed such plans, their responses to the pandemic would be more similar than they are different. True, states' plans would vary slightly - what's best for Montana may differ from what works for Connecticut. But if each state followed the best, science-based recommendations, there would be much more consistency in these emergency orders than what we've seen.\nThis hodgepodge of policies has created a mountain of legal uncertainty. This is a boon for lawyers, of course, but a potentially costly confusion for the rest of us. Ballotpedia, a nonprofit, online political encyclopedia, is tracking about 900 lawsuits nationwide related to the states' emergency policies. And it acknowledges this is only a partial list.\nSome actions taken by governors were consistently shot down by the courts. For example, several governors suspended nonelective medical procedures, but courts have ruled this illegal in Tennessee, Oklahoma and Texas. If states followed a plan they had prepared in advance, they would be able to avoid some foreseeable missteps.\nVideo: Senate fails to advance 'targeted' $300B coronavirus bill; relief in limbo (FOX News)\nYet, states seem to find themselves in legal turmoil no matter what they do. Some are being sued for closing businesses and others are being sued for opening them back up. They have been sued for suspending in-person schooling and for allowing it again. Churches are suing the government and the government is suing churches. In California, members of a church sued Los Angeles County for prohibiting them from gathering. Meanwhile, in Ventura County, public officials are suing a church there for conducting services.\nSome states seem unprepared even for basic legal questions about how to handle a public health emergency. In Michigan, for example, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is relying on a rarely used and obscure law from 1945 concerning urban riots to issue emergency orders that have the force of law, without having to consult the state legislature. This raises an obvious separation-of-powers issue, and its constitutionality needs to be decided by the Michigan Supreme Court. Executive branch officials in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, among others, have faced legal challenges to similar fundamental governance questions.\nTo be fair, states still may face lawsuits even with prepared emergency response plans. And because lockdowns and similar pandemic policies involve federally protected rights, such as the freedom of religion and assembly, there's only so much states can do. At a minimum, though, a state could settle the predictable but yet unresolved legal questions, such as those that are still up in the air in Michigan and elsewhere.\nAll this controversy, of course, is amplified by partisan interests, who have demonstrated a willingness to exploit it to score political points. If a state followed predetermined procedures, ones ideally developed in a bipartisan fashion, that would make it more difficult for people to politicize their responses to emergencies.\nIf states had properly prepared for dealing with a pandemic such as COVID-19, governors would have a better sense of their legal authority. The public then would not have to wait for a court to determine which policies apply and which do not. Governors could steer clear of policies that might be overturned in court and could provide a much more consistent approach to their states' response.\nThe effectiveness of a state's emergency orders increases with the citizens' willingness to comply with them. Easy-to-understand and predictable policies make that more likely. Yet, we have seen anything but those from states in this pandemic. Between now and the next widespread public health challenge, states should develop preparedness plans that are consistent and on solid legal ground.\nMichael Van Beek is director of research at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Midland, Mich."}, {"RECORDID": "20200601-63031", "label": 0, "title": "WHO pushes to keep ties with 'generous' U.S. despite Trump's exit move | Reuters", "body": "By Kate Kelland , Josephine Mason\n3 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday praised the United States\u2019 \u201cimmense\u201d and \u201cgenerous\u201d contribution to global health in a push to salvage relations after President Donald Trump said he was severing ties with the U.N. agency.\nAccusing it of pandering to China and overlooking an initially secretive response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Trump said on Friday he was ending Washington\u2019s relationship with the WHO.\nBut WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online media briefing he hoped his organisation could continue its longstanding collaboration with the United States.\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 contribution and generosity towards global health over many decades has been immense, and it has made a great difference in public health all around the world,\u201d he said.\nChina has reacted furiously to Trump\u2019s move, calling it selfish and petulant politics by a U.S. administration \u201caddicted\u201d to quitting international bodies and treaties.\nTedros, who is Ethiopian, said he only knew about the U.S. decision from the media, with no formal communication yet from Trump\u2019s government.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), seizing on newly declassified details of a Justice Department watchdog report, are asking FBI Director Christopher Wray to hand over all records related to \"Crossfire Hurricane,\" the name for the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\"We are deeply troubled by the Crossfire Hurricane team's awareness of and apparent indifference to Russian disinformation, as well as by the grossly inaccurate statements by the FBI official in charge of the investigation and its supervisory intelligence analyst,\" the two GOP senators wrote Thursday in a letter to Wray.\nThe letter comes after Republicans received new information from recently declassified footnotes in Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court warrants targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Horowitz's report found 17 \"significant inaccuracies and omissions\" in the Page warrant applications in 2016 and 2017.\nThe findings have sparked a shakeup of the FISA system, with Congress debating tighter restrictions, the FBI taking corrective action and a broader review underway of FISA warrant applications. An interim report released by Horowitz late last month reviewed 29 FISA applications and found errors with all of them.\nBut the new details being touted by Johnson and Grassley relate to the so-called Steele Dossier, a compilation of opposition research against then-candidate Trump spearheaded by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele.\nThe footnotes, which still contain some redactions, show the FBI was warned that some of the information Steele received could have been part of a Russian disinformation effort.\nAnother declassified footnote says two people affiliated with the Russian intelligence service \"were aware of Steele's election investigation in early July 2016,\" but an analyst told Horowitz that while he was aware of the report \"he had no information as of June 2017 that Steele's election reporting source network had been penetrated or compromised.\"\n\"As we can see from these now-declassified footnotes in the [inspector general's] report, Russian intelligence was aware of the dossier before the FBI even began its investigation and the FBI had reports in hand that their central piece of evidence was most likely tainted with Russian disinformation,\" Grassley and Johnson said in a joint statement.\nRepublicans have homed in for months on the Steele dossier, with Trump and his allies arguing it was the predicate for the FBI's decision to open an investigation into the Trump campaign and Moscow.\nBut Horowitz, in his report on the Page warrant, said the FBI's investigation was properly initiated. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in December he said the Steele dossier \"had no impact\" on the initiation of the FBI's investigation.\nHowever, the watchdog acknowledged in his December report that there was concern within the FBI that Russia was trying to feed disinformation to Steele.\n\"The Crossfire Hurricane team was aware of the potential for Russian disinformation to influence Steele's reporting,\" Horowitz wrote.\nThe declassified footnotes released by Grassley and Johnson elaborate on the concern about potential Russian interference. One says the FBI's team had been notified by an individual, whose name is redacted, of the \"potential for Russian disinformation influencing Steele's election reporting.\"\nAccording to the footnote in Horowitz's findings, a 2017 report from an individual, whose name is also redacted, raised concerns about a subset of reporting relating specifically to now-former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.\nThe individual \"stated that it did not have high confidence in this subset of Steele's reporting and assessed that the referenced subset was part of a Russian disinformation campaign to denigrate U.S. foreign relations,\" the declassified footnote reads.\nIn addition to the new disclosures from Grassley and Johnson, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) released details of the Judiciary Committee's probe into the FISA warrant process.\nPart of the documents released by Graham, who created a new website for the committee probe, include newly declassified DOJ material including George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and redacted warrant applications against Page.\n\"I'm committed to being as transparent as possible about the circumstances surrounding FISA abuse. The goal is to make sure it never happens again,\" Graham said in a statement.\nThe focus on the origins of the Russia campaign comes as Grassley and Johnson's separate investigation into Hunter Biden and Burisma Holdings is largely in limbo sparked by the Senate recess and a fight within the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which Johnson chairs, on subpoenas.\nThe investigations have sparked running tensions with Democrats on the committees, who view them as an effort to target former Vice President Joe Biden, in regard to the Burisma probe, or to undermine the FBI's investigation into Russian election interference, in regard to the probes on its origins.\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller's report, published after his nearly 22-month investigation, found that Russia sought to help President Trump defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 but that his campaign did not directly assist in that process.\nMueller's report also outlined 10 episodes of potential obstruction of justice by Trump.\nTrump and some of his fiercest allies have decried Mueller's investigation as a \"witch hunt.\" Republicans, after the investigation wrapped up, pledged they would \"investigate the investigators.\"\nActing Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, in a letter turning over a new tranche of declassified footnotes, said he consulted with Attorney General William Barr.\nBarr, who has launched his own investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, has come under criticism by Democrats for his comments about the initial FBI investigation.\nSens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Jeffrey Ragsdale, acting director of the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Professional Responsibility and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz asking for an investigation into whether Barr's \"statements in matters involving the interests of the President violate applicable Justice Department policies and rules of professional conduct.\"\nIn the letter, the two senators point to a recent Fox News interview where Barr said the FBI's investigation was started \"without any basis.\"\n\"I think the president has every right to be frustrated,\" Barr said during the interview, \"because I think what happened to him was one of the greatest travesties in American history.\"\nThe two Democratic senators noted that Horowitz found the \"FBI had a legitimate legal and factual basis to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.\"\n\"It is critical that the American people have confidence in the work of the Justice Department,\" they added, \"which requires that all of its employees \u2014 and most importantly, the Attorney General \u2014 be truthful and impartial.\""}, {"RECORDID": "20200528-88547", "label": 1, "title": "WorkJam Launches Next-Generation Health Check Analysis Tool, Advancing the Safety of Frontline Workforces", "body": "Industry-leading digital workplace platform introduces new tool to reduce the spread of COVID-19 among frontline employees and their customers\nMONTREAL , May 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- WorkJam , the leading digital workplace solutions provider for organizations with frontline employees, today announced the release of its new, next-generation health check analysis tool, enabling employers to reduce the spread of COVID-19 among frontline employees and their customers while complying with local laws and regulations.\nAs businesses around the world prepare to reopen physical stores, the onus is on employers to ensure reboarded staff feel safe returning to their workplace.

But it is more likely that activity will only be restarted gradually and may need to be slowed again if the virus resurges, he said.\nThe Fed can continue to expand its balance sheet, he said, and offer other programs as needed to keep markets functioning and banks lending. The debt-financed fiscal rescue, in the form of lifelines to both businesses and individuals - will also be important to keep people afloat while the pandemic continues.\nThere could be some permanent scars, he added, including a possible increase in the concentration of industry among fewer players, if many small businesses never recover; persistent caution among consumers worried about another crisis; and changes to the travel industry, including cruises.\nAnd it will be a \u201cvery very tough and scary period,\u201d he said.

Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) with the Xoft \u00ae Axxent \u00ae Electronic Brachytherapy (eBx \u00ae ) System \u00ae offers a viable solution that could potentially alleviate the burden to our health system, while enabling clinicians to administer high-quality care to patients who are candidates, while minimizing their potential exposure to the novel coronavirus.\u201d\nXoft breast IORT is a single-fraction therapy option that allows select early-stage breast cancer patients to replace weeks of daily radiation with one treatment, delivered at the time of surgery. This targeted treatment option offers a full course of radiation in just one day, which could contribute to a reduction in the healthcare system resources needed for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce those patients\u2019 risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus by minimizing the number of visits required to a hospital or medical facility.\n\u201cIn the recent months during the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital resources have become limited in many areas, and guidelines issued by a number of medical societies advise clinicians to determine how best to triage the care of cancer patients safely. 1 Some breast cancer patients are choosing to delay parts of their treatment for safety concerns,\u201d according to Sadia Khan, DO, FACS, Assistant Clinical Professor of Surgery at Keck School of Medicine, USC, Director of Integrative Breast Oncology at Hoag Breast Program. \u201cIn areas where there is still a high incidence of COVID-19, some patients with breast cancer may opt to choose IORT, which offers a one-dose radiation option for patients who meet the criteria. For those who are candidates, IORT gives patients an additional option to complete their radiation in a one-time dose, which decreases their exposure to the hospital.\u201d\nPositive results from a long-term study involving Xoft breast IORT conducted at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian were published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology in 2019. 2 Led by Melvin J. Silverstein, MD, Medical Director of the Hoag Breast Center, the prospective study, titled Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT): A Series of 1000 Tumors , found breast cancer recurrence rates of patients who were treated with Xoft breast IORT were comparable to those seen in the cornerstone, randomized TARGIT-A and ELIOT trials, which evaluated IORT using different technology.\n\u201cA number of breast cancer patients at our facility have had their treatment delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is concerning to physicians and patients alike, as some cases could potentially progress and it could result in a considerable backlog of patients who require urgent treatment with more advanced disease,\u201d according to Michael Howard, PhD, DABMP, RSO, Director of Oncology Services, Chief of Medical Physics, Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute, Parkridge Medical Center, HCA Healthcare. \u201cThe concern for a second wave of COVID is very real, but IORT offers a way to help reduce this potential backlog.\u201d\n\u201cThe reality is, IORT may be able to play a bigger role right now in the treatment of patients. In some cases, it may be ultimately more beneficial to offer IORT to avoid the backlog in treatment as a means of not overrunning hospitals and radiation centers once we are back up and running,\u201d added Barry Rosen, MD, FACS, Chief of Breast Surgery, Advocate Healthcare and Managing Partner, TME. \u201cIORT is one of those exceptional interventions that I believe satisfies the triple aim in treatment: it offers benefits to patients, providers and payers alike. For patients, it offers added convenience, with better cosmetic outcomes and fewer side effects; from a physician standpoint there is an inherent efficiency, as it enables them to condense one month of daily treatments to a single dose of targeted radiation. Lastly, for payers, the overall cost of treatment is reduced as the course of treatment may be reduced from weeks of daily fractions to one concentrated dose of radiation, administered at the time of surgery.\u201d\n\u201cAs clinicians, we are going to have to adapt to the COVID-19 situation as it evolves. At a certain point, delaying treatment for even early-stage breast cancer is going to come with risk. In many cases, the decision really should be made to go forward with cancer treatment; IORT offers a treatment option that may allow more women to get the treatment they need during this time,\u201d according to Charles Wesley Hodge, MD, Radiation Oncologist, Florida Hospital Celebration Health/AdventHealth. \u201cWe are facing an unprecedented challenge in healthcare, and as clinicians we need to come together and adjust to these new realities. For those of us who practice in the oncology space, it is particularly challenging because we are dealing with a potentially life-threatening illness that requires appropriate management. Now is the time for clinicians to work together, to adjust to our new reality, and to come up with an approach that will do the greatest good for our patients.\u201d\nThis virtual roundtable event is a part of larger series of webinars hosted by iCAD in recent weeks, featuring leading experts in breast cancer detection and treatment.

But one South Tyrolean vintner in the northern province of Bolzano took matters into his own hands, renting a plane to fly in his team of long-time workers from Romania. Every summer, tens of thousands of farm workers from Africa and Eastern Europe come to Italy to harvest fruit and vegetables. The outbreak of coronavirus, which locked down Italy in early March, made it almost impossible for these vital foreign workers to come. Martin Hofstaetter, whose vines are located around the picturesque town of Termeno, has relied for more than ten years on a team of female Romanian pickers. Usually, they arrive in a small bus and stay for a few months. But this year, despite having the right to work in Italy, they were turned away at the Hungarian border. Hofstaetter was quick to act, hiring a small plane to transport the women directly from Romania to Termeno at his own expense. \"We had never been on a plane before. It was a great experience for us,\" Maria Codrea, from Calinesti in Romania, told AFPTV. Codrea, 39, said she depended on the annual work in Italy. Staying back in Romania \"would have been hard,\" she said. \"Even where we are, everything is closed, factories and everything.\" - Italians hard to find - Codrea will stay until mid-July in Termeno with her team of seven other Romanian women before returning home. A second team of about 20 workers from Romania will arrive in Termeno at the end of August for the harvest. Hofstaetter, whose wines include the famous white varieties of Italy's northeast, said he might have been able to find Italian workers, \"but now the Italians no longer want to work in the fields or vineyards.\" \"The Italians disappear after a few days\" of the back-breaking work, he added. It was a shame that work in agriculture was not \"more highly valued\", he said, but he was very happy with the skills and dedication of the Romanians, who had been picking for him for over 10 years. Last week, the first group of about 100 foreign farm workers arrived in Italy from Morocco, their transport paid for by a farmers' association in the eastern region of Abruzzo. For Codrea, it is not difficult work among Hofstaetter's family vines in the Adige Valley, with the sound of the birds, and views of the mountains and a nearby church steeple. \"We're used to the work.

In late June, he finally got through but was told he had to wait three billing cycles for his money to be credited to his bank account.\nAlmost 60 days after that call, he called again and was told he would get his money back, except for $349 in taxes.\nThis week, he filed a complaint with the DOT.\nPAL did not respond to our three requests for a response to Follet\u2019s predicament.\nBut the DOT did respond to our questions about Follett\u2019s best course of action.\n\u201cAirlines have an obligation to provide a refund to a ticketed passenger when the carrier cancels or significantly changes the passenger\u2019s flight and the passenger chooses not to accept an alternative offered by the carrier,\u201d a DOT spokesman told me.\n\u201cThe department\u2019s refund regulation requires that airlines provide prompt refunds where ticket refunds are due. It defines prompt as being within seven business days if a passenger paid by credit card and within 20 days if a passenger paid by cash or check.\u201d\nBecause of the overwhelming number of refund requests, the DOT isn\u2019t holding airlines\u2019 feet to the fire with the same rigor \u201cif those carriers are making good faith efforts to provide refunds in a timely manner,\u201d a May FAQ from the DOT said.\nIt's not known whether what happened to Follett registers as a \u201cgood faith effort,\u201d but the DOT also noted that he could file a complaint with the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection at bit.ly/DOTAviationComplaintForm.\nThe DOT said the airline must acknowledge the consumer within 30 days of receiving the complaint and respond within 60 days.\nAnd what about that $349 that PAL wants to withhold for taxes? Nope, the DOT said. That\u2019s part of the price of the ticket, so it must be returned to the customer as well.\nIf all goes as the DOT timeline suggests, Follett should hear back from PAL by the end of October, 121 days since he was able to get through to the airline to request a refund. Whether he will get his $349 in taxes refunded also appears to be a question in PAL\u2019s mind, although not the DOT\u2019s.\nI\u2019d love to share some sage advice with you to ensure that you never get entangled in such a mess, but these are extraordinary times, cubed.\nIt\u2019s always better to pay with a credit card instead of a debit card, but even if Follett had, by the time he found out his flight wasn\u2019t taking off, the 60-day window for disputing a charge under the Fair Credit Billing Act would have expired. (You do not have to pay the disputed part of your bill while the investigation is pending.)\nCould he have contacted PAL sooner than June 29? Perhaps, if he had wanted to make a career out of calling a number that he said was always busy.\nShould he have called back after PAL said yes to a refund? Unknowable. At least he now realizes that he\u2019s also due a refund for the $349 in taxes, despite what PAL said.\nHere\u2019s what Winston Churchill said in fall 1941, just a few months after the end of Germany\u2019s blitz against Britain killed 43,000 and injured 139,000: \u201cNever give in, never give in, never, never, never, never \u2014 in nothing, great or small, large or petty \u2014 never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.\u201d\nThe size of Follett\u2019s tussle is minuscule by comparison, but the sentiment suggests a course for those who believe every company should do what\u2019s right and fair.\nHave a problem, dilemma or issue that\u2019s travel-related?

Due to weak safety protocols, an infected lab worker then went to a wet market where the virus spread.\nWhen the Fox News reporter John Roberts put this to Trump at a press briefing on Wednesday, he replied: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to say that, John, but I will tell you more and more we\u2019re hearing the story.\u201d\nRelated: California launches $125m disaster relief fund for immigrants, first in nation\nThe president is notorious for recycling content from Fox News in his remarks or tweets, and it was unclear whether he was privy to any other information to back the claim.

There is no evidence for this. The scientific journal the Lancet has stated the virus appears to have come from wildlife. An analysis by scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology suggests that the virus\u2019s genome is 96% similar to a coronavirus found in bats.\nBut the story running prominently on Fox News begins by stating the virus began \u201cnot as a bioweapon\u201d, alleging incompetence rather than a malicious attack. This idea has gained more traction, especially among anti-China hardliners in Washington.\nOn Tuesday the Washington Post reported that state department cables had warned two years ago of safety issues at a Wuhan lab studying bat coronaviruses. The Post said: \u201cThe cables have fueled discussions inside the US government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus \u2013 even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge.\u201d\nChina\u2019s extreme censorship and lack of openness about the virus have done little to quell the speculation. But conversely, healthy scepticism is guaranteed because of Fox News\u2019 widely panned coverage of the pandemic as well as Trump\u2019s habit of searching for distractions and excuses to shift blame.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s coronavirus taskforce briefing, he lambasted the Voice of America radio station for its China coverage \u2013 \u201cwhat things they say are disgusting toward our country\u201d \u2013 and the World Health Organization (WHO) for giving Beijing the benefit of the doubt.\n\u201cIt took them a long time to realise what was going on, but I have a feeling they knew exactly what was going on,\u201d he said without evidence, having previously announced a hold on WHO funding. \u201cTragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn\u2019t do any formal [travel] ban.\u201d\nMeanwhile Trump, under pressure to restart the economy, struck an optimistic note for America\u2019s fight against the virus on a cold day in the White House rose garden. \u201cThe battle continues but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases,\u201d he said, without giving details to support the claim. \u201cHopefully that will continue, and we will continue to make great progress.\n\u201cThese encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalise guidelines on states for reopening the country.\u201d\nThe White House will release the guidelines on Thursday, he added, after he and Vice-President Mike Pence hold calls with governors. \u201cWe think that some states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1.\u201d\nTrump added: \u201cWe\u2019ll be the comeback kids \u2013 all of us \u2026 Tomorrow\u2019s going to be a very big day \u2026 We\u2019ll have some openings that will exceed our expectations.

In fact, half of the states in America have less than 2,500 cases per state.\u201d\nBut public health experts have warned that the US, which has the biggest caseload in the world, must boost testing and contact tracing before loosening restrictions. Trump said the US has surpassed 3.3m completed tests but failed to answer governors\u2019 concerns over how the process can be stepped up.\nRelated: Trump and Fox News: the dangerous relationship shaping America's coronavirus response\nIn an unexpected turn, he also threatened to force Congress into a formal recess so that he can make recess appointments of federal officials, including judges.

This is the second lowest in a four-level system over there. An alert was issued in the region, forbidding hunting and eating of animals that may potentially carry the plague.

Details to follow.\nA consultant clinical virologist at Cambridge University has said that the concerning reports from South Korea about people having recovered from the coronavirus only to test positive again were likely due to the ineffectiveness of the Covid-19 test, which can easily produce \u201cfalse negatives\u201d.\n\u201cThey reflect probably that the test isn\u2019t great. And the way in which we are sampling people for the virus isn\u2019t perfect,\u201d Dr Chris Smith said on RNZ\u2019s Saturday Morning. He said the test can return false negatives because often too little tissue is taken from the lungs or throat in the swab. This results in a patient appearing to have completely recovered (testing negative) from the virus, when in fact it was present all along. However, he said that even if the virus was still present in recovering patients, their antibodies were likely mounting a response which would eventually provide at least short-term immunity from Covid-19. \u201cI\u2019m confident that people who are fighting this off are making neutralising antibodies that will give them at least short term protection.\u201d\nHe said there was no reason that there wouldn\u2019t be long term protection but due to the fickle nature of coronaviruses more data would need to be collected over a longer time frame.\nThe NZ Herald has published a revealing feature on New Zealand\u2019s suddenly-very-high-profile director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield. While the good doctor didn\u2019t participate (making it a donut, in the journalistic parlance), many former colleagues did, revealing what writer David Fisher rightly characterises as a career spent building inexorably toward this moment.\nThis passage is particularly revealing, in part because who knew Kim Hill moonlit as a private as well as public interrogator of those destined for high office?\n\u201cThe hunt for a new, permanent director-general was extensive. There were 27 candidates who applied. Of those short-listed, they faced an interview panel of four, and an hour on the end of a Kim Hill inquisition, with psychologists looking on.\n\u201cUltimately, it was Bloomfield who took over. \u201cI thought he would be perfect,\u201d says Northland District Health Board chief executive Dr Nick  Chamberlain. \u201cI encouraged him to take it and I\u2019m sure others did as well.\u00a0Ashley was the perfect mix of having worked in the ministry, being a public health physician and having then worked in DHBs and done a good job there as well.\u00a0He also knew the machinery of government and how government works.

RNZ reports Elizabeth Hall from the Defence Lawyers Association as saying it could cause year-long delays in some cases, with defendants potentially pleading guilty rather than waiting for a jury.\n\u201cThe people who are awaiting trial are presumed to be innocent,\u201d said Hall. \u201cSo the risk is that people who are in fact innocent feel the pressure to plead guilty just to get it over and done with, because they can\u2019t bear waiting and because they may end up being in custody longer waiting than if they just pleaded and got it out of the way.\u201d\nHall said extending the suspension of jury trials would have a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d on victims, witnesses and defendants. \u201cThat is the prosecution not being able to continue because of the unfair way that people have to wait so long for their hearings. So we\u2019re going to need to see whether New Zealand adopts that line as well and starts to be proactive in culling some of the cases that need to be heard.\u201d\nRead the full story on RNZ\nThe NRL has been one of the most bullish sport leagues in the world when it comes to a return post-Covid-19, with chair of the Australian Rugby League Commission, Peter V\u2019Landys, saying it would return on May 28. Yesterday however NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said that there had been no contact between the NRL and his officials, a position backed up by the state\u2019s deputy chief medical officer. Newshub reports that V\u2019Landys remains resolute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the NSW public health order that we are exempt,\u201d Newshub reported him as saying. \u201cWe also received a letter last Wednesday from relevant government authority confirming we can train and play. This is the mistake everyone has made. It is seven weeks away. In that seven weeks there will be some form of relaxation of the social distancing measures. Rugby league, like it or not is a workplace. Other workplaces are continuing to operate. The risk now is minimal.\u201d\nThe NRL has discussed various ideas about how it might return, including teams all living at a locked-down island resort for long enough to play out the rest of the season, according to one proposal floated by the committee tasked with finding ways to salvage the sport after it was shut down by Covid-19.\nNZ Transit, workplace and residential data (image: Google)\nGoogle mobility data covering most of the second week of lockdown shows New Zealand continuing to comply with the rules imposed by the level four lockdown. Compared with week one , the country is near identical in the six categories reported on by Google\u2019s global mobility data, and remains behaviourally far closer to nations like Italy and Spain, which have been hit hardest by Covid-19, than those with more patchwork guidance on the issue, like the US.\nThe one notable exception is Wellington, which has had a comparative surge in park usage compared to last week. In week one it had shown a lower propensity to stay away from parks, at -63%, versus the national average of -78%. That gap has widened considerably in week two, with the national average moving marginally to -74%, while Wellington\u2019s rose to just -40%.\nRead the full story on The Spinoff\nA grim milestone this morning, as the global death toll surpassed 100,000 , nearly double the 58,000 recorded just a week ago. The US is on the verge of passing Italy for the most deaths linked to the virus, with 18,330 to 18,849. Despite the mounting toll, US president Donald Trump is said to be targeting May 1 to reopen the economy , according to a Washington Post report. This is in line with his public hints, where despite shying away from naming a date, he appeared bullish on one coming soon. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019re going to be opening up \u2013 you could call it opening \u2013 very, very, very, very soon, I hope,\u201d Trump said at his daily briefing.\nWhile he has shied away from publicly naming May 1, the day after formal guidelines end on April 30, the Post reports a number of aides as confirming his interest in that date, tallying with a public affirmation of a May target from treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin. The Centre for Disease Control\u2019s Anthony Fauci sounded a note of caution , however, appearing to suggest that the month\u2019s end would be a good time to reassess, rather than reopen. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a good time to look and see how quickly can we make that move to try and normalise,\u201d Fauci told CNBC. \u201cHopefully by the time we get to the summer, we will have taken many steps in that direction.\u201d\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, was far more cautious on prospects for reopening the world\u2019s economies. \u201cI know that some countries are already planning the transition out of stay-at-home restrictions,\u201d he said at a press conference in Geneva. \u201cWHO wants to see restrictions lifted as much as anyone. At the same time, lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence. The way down can be as dangerous as the way up if not managed properly.\u201d\nA concerning report from Reuters this morning says 91 patients who were considered recovered from Covid-19 have tested positive again, according to Kim Woo-joo, professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital. It\u2019s too early to say what this means \u2013 the most likely explanation is that patients have \u2018relapsed\u2019 rather than being reinfected, or the virus could continue to exist in the patients, without necessarily posing a danger to themselves or others. Nonetheless, it remains a major concern, given its potential impact on countries pursuing a herd immunity strategy. Epidemiological studies are continuing to attempt to understand what is behind the results. South Korea remains a global success story in terms of its control of the virus, with 27 new infections announced yesterday, down from a peak of 900 in late February.\nLater this morning Dr Chris Smith, a clinical virologist at Cambridge, appeared with Kim Hill on RNZ, and suggested the results were more likely to be false positives, as the tests for Covid-19 remain unreliable.\nTech giants Google and Apple have announced they are teaming up to accelerate and automate tracing of those who have been in contact with a cellphone user who signals that they have tested positive for Covid-19. The pair, which dominate the market for cellphone operating systems, announced this morning that they are working on a system which would log user interactions using bluetooth technology, automatically alerting users when someone with whom they have recently been in close proximity indicates that they have tested positive for the virus.\n\u201cAll of us at Apple and Google believe there has never been a more important moment to work together to solve one of the world\u2019s most pressing problems,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cThrough close cooperation and collaboration with developers, governments and public health providers, we hope to harness the power of technology to help countries around the world slow the spread of Covid-19 and accelerate the return of everyday life.\u201d\nThe tech giants\u2019 huge advantage is the scale of market penetration, as Apple and Google dominate the world\u2019s smartphones, with a combined market share of around 98%. Yet this is not currently envisaged as being incorporated into a system update, but a new app which users would have to download. While both firms underscored that both identity and whereabouts would be anonymised, some are likely to mistrust both governments and tech companies on privacy. There is also the risk of unnecessary alarm or misuse, with a user unable to know which of their recent contacts had tested positive.\nOther challenges are more technical, not least of which is the variable range of bluetooth. The technology is typically used to link devices with speakers, headphones or keyboards, and can often pass through walls or floors, or from one end of a train carriage to another. The danger of the exaggerating risk posed can be diminished by overlaying the amount of time devices spent in proximity with one another, as a similar system in use in Singapore does. Its government has an app called TraceTogether, which New Zealand has shown interest in, an opt-in system has had a relatively low uptake \u2013 one million users, in a population of six million, have installed it. This is well below the three quarters of a population considered the minimum for it to be an effective weapon against the virus. Additionally, Apple and Google were at pains to say that this would be in support of, rather than a replacement for, a more manual contact tracing process.\nThe announcement underscores the scale of this challenge, and the potential of technology to play a part in the fight against it. Under normal circumstances such a collaboration would be not just commercially untenable, but potentially subject to anti-competitive scrutiny. Yet the threat posed by the pandemic has forced arguably the world\u2019s most fierce business rivalry to band together.\nThere is no briefing scheduled at this stage for today. None was scheduled for yesterday, either, though that was changed mid-morning, which may have been so that the news of a second Covid-19 linked death could be conveyed in person. Either way, we\u2019ll keep you posted on the latest news and numbers.\nTwo of the most prominent public health experts in New Zealand\u2019s Covid-19 response have penned an op-ed for the Guardian . Michael Baker and Nick Wilson of the University of Otago write: \u201cNew Zealand now appears to be the only \u2018western\u2019 nation following an articulated elimination strategy with the goal of completely ending transmission of Covid-19 within its borders.\u201d\nThe approach is one that could work in a number of other nations, write the authors, who hail \u201cthe brilliant, decisive and humane leadership of Jacinda Ardern\u201d, which was \u201cinstrumental in New Zealand\u2019s rapid change in direction with its response to Covid-19 and the remarkably efficient implementation of the elimination strategy\u201d.\nThey add: \u201cThe lockdown does, however, have massive short-term social and economic costs for New Zealand, and will be particularly tough for those with the least resources, including M\u0101ori and Pacific populations and low-income New Zealanders.\u201d\nA number of international outlets including the Washington Post and CNN have hailed New Zealand\u2019s \u201celimination strategy\u201d in recent days.

Doug Ducey declared gun shops an \u201cessential service\u201d in his March 23 executive order that shut down many other nonessential businesses.\nDucey\u2019s decision was praised last month by the National Rifle Association, which says on its website that the COVID-19 outbreak is a threat to the Second Amendment.\n\u201cNothing is more important than protecting ourselves and our families \u2014 especially during these times of uncertainty,\u201d the NRA site says. It goes on to claim that some lawmakers are \u201cexploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to deny you and your loved ones your fundamental right to self-defense and your Second Amendment rights.\u201d\nBut Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun violence movement, said it is the NRA that is exploiting the pandemic to drive gun sales by \u201cfear mongering.\u201d\n\u201cThe NRA\u2019s suggestion that Americans should stockpile firearms during this pandemic is rooted in the organization\u2019s desire to line the pockets of gun manufacturers,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cMore guns don\u2019t mean more safety: If more guns made Americans safe, then we\u2019d be the safest nation in the world \u2013 but America\u2019s homicide rate is 25 times than that of other high-income countries.\u201d\nFlagstaff resident Marisa Scionti volunteers with Moms Demand Action, which is part of Everytown. She hopes gun owners, especially new owners, are being responsible with their guns because of the tragic consequences of irresponsible gun ownership.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that parents, people who are gun owners, whether they\u2019re new guns or old guns, are being very careful to lock them up,\u201d Scionti said. \u201cEspecially now that there\u2019s children at home all day long.\u201d\nMark Healy, who owns Healy \u2013 America\u2019s Firearm Provider, a large-volume dealer in Tempe, said he takes the responsibilities of gun ownership seriously. During last month\u2019s rush, he said, he handed out as many cards for gun training to people who were \u201cunprepared for gun ownership\u201d as he did applications for gun purchase.\nHealy, who said he worked 20 days straight in March, said cheaper handguns \u2013 anything below $400 \u2013 \u201cwent right away\u201d and were extremely popular. He also said shoppers were buying more ammunition than they normally would and his store quickly ran out of popular items.\n\u201cThey were certainly trying to beat the curve,\u201d he said.\nHealy said he does not have enough 9mm and basic-range ammo because it got \u201choarded right away.\u201d He has enough stock to supply someone who just bought a gun but will not sell ammunition alone. While things have slowed down recently, he said he still has enough stock to supply most buyers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still out of some things right now, but for anybody walking in right now looking for a handgun or long gun, we can certainly supply that,\u201d Healy said. \u201cNot to the variety that we could before this started but to a large degree\u2026. We\u2019ve been bringing in quite a bit of things every day to replenish.\u201d\nSemenko also said ammunition is in high demand. He said business slows down when stocks are low \u2013 but other times there can be a line out the door. When his Tucson shop recently got 9mm ammunition in stock, there were 100 people waiting in line when the doors opened.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really what it boils down to is having enough ammo to protect your family if something was to happen,\u201d Semenko said.\nHe said there is still a constant flow of customers coming in to get \u201cwhat they need.\u201d\n\u201cPeople are worried about other people, they want to be able to defend their possessions and their families,\u201d Semenko said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to expect. They see what happens in the grocery stores when things get a little bit low and they don\u2019t want to be at the mercy of those people.\u201d\nFollow Cronkite News on Twitter .\nFor more stories from Cronkite News, visit cronkitenews.azpbs.org ."}, {"RECORDID": "20200309-69362", "label": -1, "title": "Saudi Aramco shares dive, Gulf debt markets hit as oil drops | Reuters", "body": "By Yousef Saba , Saeed Azhar\n4 Min Read\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco 2222.SE shares fell by as much as 10% on Monday, dropping below their December listing price after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would raise oil production in a battle for market share, sending crude prices down by a third.\nGovernment bonds from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf oil producing countries were also pummeled after the collapse of the deal between OPEC, Russia and other oil producers that had propped up oil prices since 2016.\nAramco shares fell below their 32 riyals initial public offering price on Sunday for the first time since trading began in December.

The December IPO valued the company at $1.7 trillion in the world\u2019s biggest share offering.\nSince then oil prices and oil companies\u2019 shares have come under pressure from fears over the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand and Russia\u2019s refusal to support deeper output cuts to bolster prices.

But to hang on to their home they rented it out through a letting agency.\nHowever, within a few months they decided the move was not working for them and decided to return to their home in the UK. \nBut in December 2019 they said their tenants stopped paying their \u00a3800 rent and refused to leave the house to allow them to return.\nThe couple claim that their tenant is still working as a car salesman, despite taking a rent holiday.\nThe situation has been further complicated by the Government introducing a ban on evictions during the pandemic.\nLandlords across the country are worried they could be left without income indefinitely if the ban is extended further. They called the eviction ban a 'kick in the teeth'.\nIt has left many 'pushed to the brink' of their finances, with nearly two in five of the country's private landlords experiencing rent arrears over the last year.\nA survey of landlords, reported by The Times , found the total owed has increased by almost \u00a3300million during the five months of lockdown.\nSome 600,000 tenants took the option to stop paying their rent, or to pay at a reduced rate as lockdown restrictions affected jobs, according to the Government.\nBen Beadle, of the National Residential Landlords Association, which conducted the survey, told the newspaper: 'Most landlords are not property tycoons with deep pockets able to subsidise rents indefinitely but are ordinary people who rely on this income to pay their living expenses.\n'Ministers must use the next four weeks to come up with a credible plan that pays off rent arrears built due to the pandemic and gets the courts hearing cases again.'\nWith courts usually dealing with up to 10,000 eviction requests a month, a significant backlog is expected once the restrictions are lifted.\nThe National Residential Landlords Association said 94 per cent of landlords rent property as an individual with 45 per cent renting out just one property and 38 per cent renting out between two and five.\nIn a letter to the PM, the association said:\u00a0 'As a result of this action, repossession cases on the grounds of rent arrears will not be treated as a priority until tenants have built over a year's worth of rent debts.\n'This means that it is entirely possible that landlords could be faced with no income for up to two years.'\nThe association said landlords will also face financial hardship themselves as a result of being unable to evict tenants who do not pay rent.\nTheir letter says the ban could mean many landlords will default on their mortgages\u00a0 and it could expose them to legal action if they are unable to meet certain requirements within their property as a result of lost income.\nThey argue landlords will be much more discerning about who they rent to if they are unable to evict tenants.\nMr Beadle said: 'The overwhelming majority of landlords have been working constructively with their tenants to sustain tenancies where rent arrears have built as a direct result of the pandemic.\n'The Government's actions are a kick in the teeth for all these landlords who have done the right thing.\n'Ministers must use the next four weeks to come up with a credible plan that pays off rent arrears built due to the pandemic and gets the courts hearing cases again.\n'Stopping landlords from legally ending failed and disruptive tenancies is not a solution.

What can I give them?\u201d\nWhile there is still no simple answer to that question, a lot has changed in the six months since an entirely new coronavirus began sweeping the globe.\nDoctors say they\u2019ve learned enough about the highly contagious virus to solve some key problems for many patients. The changes could be translating into more saved lives, although there is little conclusive data.\nNearly 30 doctors around the world, from New Orleans to London to Dubai, told Reuters they feel more prepared should cases surge again in the fall.\n\n\u201c\u200bWe are well-positioned for a second wave,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWe know so much more.\u201d\nDoctors like Patel now have:\n*A clearer grasp of the disease\u2019s side effects, like blood clotting and kidney failure\n*A better understanding of how to help patients struggling to breathe\n*More information on which drugs work for which kinds of patients.\nThey also have acquired new tools to aid in the battle, including:\n*Widespread testing\n*Promising new treatments like convalescent plasma, antiviral drugs and steroids\n*An evolving spate of medical research and anecdotal evidence, which doctors share across institutions, and sometimes across oceans.\nDespite a steady rise in COVID-19 cases, driven to some extent by wider testing, the daily death toll from the disease is falling in some countries, including the United States. Doctors say they are more confident in caring for patients than they were in the chaotic first weeks of the pandemic, when they operated on nothing but blind instinct.\nIn June, an average of 4,599 people a day died from COVID-19 worldwide, down from 6,375 a day in April, according to Reuters data.\nNew York's Northwell Health reported a fatality rate of 21% for COVID-19 patients admitted to its hospitals in March. That rate is now closer to 10%, due to a combination of earlier treatment and improved patient management, Dr. Thomas McGinn, director of Northwell's Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, told Reuters.\n\"I think everybody is seeing that,\" he said. \"I think people are coming in sooner, there is better use of blood thinners, and a lot of small things are adding up.\"\nEven nuts-and-bolts issues, like how to re-organize hospital space to handle a surge of COVID-19 patients and secure personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical workers, are not the time-consuming, mad scrambles they were before.\n\u201cThe hysteria of who\u2019d take care of (hospital staff) is not there anymore,\u201d said Dr. Andra Blomkalns, head of emergency medicine at Stanford Health Care, a California hospital affiliated with Stanford University. \u201cWe have an entire team whose only job is getting PPE.\u201d\nTo be sure, the world is far from safe from a virus that continues to rage. It is expected to reach two grim milestones in the next several days: 10 million confirmed global infections and 500,000 deaths. As of Thursday evening, more than 9.5 million people had tested positive for the coronavirus, and more than 483,000 had died, according to Reuters data. The United States remains the epicenter of the pandemic, and cases are rising at an alarming pace in states like Arizona, Florida and Texas.\nThere is still no surefire treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, which often starts as a respiratory illness but can spread to attack organs including the heart, liver, kidneys or central nervous system. Scientists are at least months away from a working vaccine.\nAnd while medical knowledge has improved, doctors continue to emphasize that the best way for people to survive is to avoid infection in the first place through good hygiene, face coverings and limited group interaction.\nDr. Ramanathan Venkiteswaran, medical director of Aster Hospitals in the United Arab Emirates, said COVID-19 will likely result in permanent changes in medicine and for the general public on \u201cbasic things like social distancing, wearing of masks and hand washing.\u201d\nLEARNING ON THE FLY\nIn the medical field, change can be slow, with years-long studies often needed before recommendations are altered. But protocols for COVID-19 have evolved at lightning speed.\nIn Brazil, S\u00e3o Paulo-based Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, one of the country\u2019s leading private hospital networks, has updated its internal guidelines for treating coronavirus patients some 50 times since the outbreak began earlier this year, according to Dr. Moacyr Silva Junior, an infectious disease specialist at the center. Those guidelines govern questions such as which patients are eligible for which drugs, how to handle patients with breathing problems, and the use of PPE like masks, gowns and gloves.\n\u201cIn only three months, a resounding amount of scientific work on COVID-19 has been published,\u201d he said.\nAt Stanford Health Care, treatment guidelines changed almost daily in the early weeks of the pandemic, Blomkalns said. She described a patchwork approach that began by following guidelines established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, then modifying them to reflect a shortage of resources, and finally adding new measures not addressed by the CDC, such as how to handle pregnant healthcare workers.\nThe new coronavirus has been particularly vexing for doctors because of the many and often unpredictable ways it can manifest. Most people infected experience only mild flu-like symptoms, but some can develop severe pneumonia, stroke and neurological disease. Doctors say the biggest advance so far has been understanding how the disease can put patients at much higher risk for blood clots. Most recently, doctors have discovered that blood type might influence how the body reacts to the virus.\n\u201cWe developed specific protocols, such as when to start blood thinners, that are different from what would be done for typical ICU patients,\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Falk, pulmonary critical care specialist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\nAround 15% of COVID-19 patients are at risk of becoming sick enough to require hospitalization. Scientists have estimated that the fatality rate could be as high as 5%, but most put the number well below 1%. People with the highest risk of severe disease include older adults and those with underlying health conditions like heart disease, diabetes and obesity.\nWhile rates of COVID-19 infection have recently been rising in many parts of the United States, the total number of U.S. patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been steadily falling since a peak in late April, according to the CDC.\nMany hospitals report success with guidelines for \"proning\" patients - positioning them on their stomachs to relieve pressure on the lungs, and hopefully stave off the need for mechanical ventilation, which many doctors said has done more harm than good.\n\u201cAt first, we had no idea how to treat severely ill patients when we (ventilate),\u201d said Dr. Satoru Hashimoto, who directs the intensive care division at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine in Japan. \u201cWe treated them in the fashion we treated influenza,\u201d only to see those patients suffer serious kidney, digestive and other problems, he said.\nHospitals say increased coronavirus testing - and faster turnaround times to get results - are also making a difference.\n\"What has really helped us triage patients is the availability of rapid testing that came on about six weeks ago,\" said Falk of Cedars-Sinai. \"Initially, we had to wait two, three or even four days to get a test back. That really clogged up the COVID areas of the hospital.\"\nFaster, wider testing also helps conserve PPE by identifying the negative patients around whom doctors don\u2019t have to wear as much gear, said Dr. Saj Patel, who treats non-critical patients at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. \u201cYou can imagine how much PPE we burned through\u201d waiting for test results, he said.\nHospitals around the world acted early to restructure operations, including floor layouts, to isolate coronavirus patients and reduce exposure to others. It wasn\u2019t always smooth, but doctors say they\u2019re figuring out how to do it more efficiently.\n\u201cOur hospital infrastructure, and the way that we ... manage people coming through the door is a lot slicker than it was earlier in the epidemic,\" said Dr. Tom Wingfield, a clinical lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool, England.\n\u2018THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DRUG\u2019\nHospitals said some of their early hunches about best treatments for COVID-19 patients ended up being wrong. Case in point: use of the anti-malaria pill hydroxychloroquine.\nIt gained attention in March, when U.S. President Donald Trump began publicly touting it. Early reports showed the drug could have some benefit, and hospitals, desperate for solutions, started giving it to critically sick patients. But subsequent trial data have told a different story, suggesting the drug is not effective for treatment or prevention, and might even cause harm. Other clinical trials of the drug are still underway.\nDr. Mangala Narasimhan, regional director of critical care at Northwell Hospital in New York, recalled the uncertainty around hydroxychloroquine. The hospital used it early on, but stopped after the negative studies were published. \u201cThat was one of our mainstays of treatment in the beginning,\u201d Narasimhan said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anything else.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s loud support for the drug turned the medical debate into a political one. That happened in Brazil, too, when far-right President Jair Bolsonaro fiercely supported hydroxychloroquine. Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, in S\u00e3o Paulo, is one of the many hospitals around the globe that have now abandoned it.\nSome patients at S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas refused to be part of clinical trials involving what they called the \u201cpresident\u2019s drug,\u201d said Dr. Mirian Dal Ben, an epidemiologist there, while others demanded to be treated with it.\nThe lingering questions about use of hydroxychloroquine highlight the hazards of quickly moving science. Hospitals normally rely on fully vetted research published by prominent medical journals like the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine to flag important medical findings. But as the pandemic built, so did the number of so-called \"pre-print\" studies that have not been peer-reviewed.\nThe Montpellier University Hospital in southern France used hydroxychloroquine on severely ill patients until the government banned the substance in May.\n\u201cI have no major regrets when looking back on the decisions that we took,\u201d said Dr. Jacques Reynes, head of infectious and tropical diseases. \u201cBut I would say that, at the beginning, we were somewhat in a fog.\u201d\nUSING WHAT'S AT HAND\nBut even if hydroxychloroquine looks unlikely as an effective COVID-19 treatment, hospitals continue to try new medications - both by repurposing older drugs and exploring novel therapies. Patients are being enrolled in hundreds of coronavirus clinical trials launched in the past three months.\nMany hospitals said they are seeing success with the use of plasma donated by survivors of COVID-19 to treat newly infected patients.\nPeople who survive an infectious disease like COVID-19 are generally left with blood containing antibodies, which are proteins made by the body\u2019s immune system to fight off a virus. The blood component that carries the antibodies, known as convalescent plasma, can be collected and given to new patients.\nEarly results from a study at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital found that patients with severe COVID-19 who were given convalescent plasma were more likely to stabilize or need less oxygen support than other similar hospital patients. But results from other studies have been mixed, and doctors still await findings from a rigorously-designed trial. And availability of plasma varies between regions.\nAt Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, \u201canecdotally everyone can provide stories\u201d of the benefits of plasma, said Dr. John Deledda, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer.\nBut in rural New Mexico, hospitals that care for largely underserved populations struggle to find it. \u201cThere\u2019s a limited number of blood centers\u201d that can provide plasma, said Valory Wangler, chief medical officer at Rehoboth McKinley Christian Health Care Services, in Gallup, New Mexico. Until trial data is more conclusive, plasma is \u201cnot something we\u2019re pursuing actively,\u201d she said.\nDr Abdullatif al-Khal, head of infectious diseases at Qatar\u2019s Hamad Medical Corporation and a co-chair of the country\u2019s pandemic preparedness team, said he saw patients improve after he started using donated plasma early in the course of COVID-19 before the patients deteriorated.\nQatar is also assessing a steroid known as dexamethasone to treat COVID-19. But Khal says he wants to wait for publication of clinical data behind a recent UK study suggesting that the steroid reduced death rates by around a third among the most severely ill COVID-19 patients.\nIn patients with severe COVID-19, the immune system can overreact, triggering a potentially harmful cascade. Steroids are an older class of drugs that suppress that inflammatory response. But they can also make it easier for other viral or bacterial infections to take hold - making doctors leery of their use in a hospital setting or in patients with early-stage COVID-19.\nSome countries, including Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, reported using HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir with some success. Clinical trials, though, have suggested little benefit, and they aren\u2019t widely used in the United States.\nMIDNIGHT DELIVERY\nMany of the doctors who spoke with Reuters were bullish on the use of remdesivir, the only drug so far shown to be effective against the coronavirus in a rigorous clinical trial. The antiviral developed by California-based Gilead Sciences Inc was shown to reduce the length of hospital stays for COVID-19 patients by about a third, but hasn\u2019t been proven to boost survival.\nRemdesivir is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host\u2019s immune system.\nIt is available under emergency approvals in several countries, including the United States. But Gilead's donated supplies are limited, and distribution and availability are uneven.\nDr. Andrew Staricco, chief medical officer at McLaren Health Care, which operates 11 hospitals across Michigan, recalls the urgency to obtain remdesivir early on. He got an email from Michigan\u2019s health department on May 9, a week after the U.S. Food & Drug Administration authorized the drug for use in treating COVID-19. The health department said it had received a small batch from the federal government, and planned to dole it out to local hospitals based on need. Staricco wrote back, saying he had 15 to 18 critically ill patients, but was given enough to treat just four.\nThe drug was so precious, he said, that state police troopers were responsible for transporting it to the hospital - which they did, dropping it off around 1 a.m. the next morning.\nHealth officials originally directed remdesivir for use on the most critically ill patients. But doctors later found they got the best results administering it earlier.\n\u201cWe started finding that, actually, the sooner you get treated with it, the better,\u201d Staricco said. \u201cWe\u2019ve revisited our criteria for giving it to patients three different times.\"\nData on the drug, he said, is still scarce. But his anecdotal observations on the benefits of early treatment were echoed by several U.S. doctors.\n\n\n\u2018COPY-CATTING\u2019\nGilead on Monday said it aims to manufacture another 2 million courses of remdesivir this year, but did not comment on how it plans to distribute, or sell, those supplies for use by hospitals. The company has licensed the antiviral to several generic drugmakers, who will be allowed to sell the medication in over 100 low-income nations.\nAlthough much about the coronavirus remains unknown, a key reason hospitals say they now are more prepared owes to teamwork.\nMany doctors described a kind of unofficial network of information sharing.\nIn hard-hit Italy, Dr. Lorenzo Dagna of the IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, organized conference calls with institutions in the United States and elsewhere to share experiences and anecdotes treating COVID-19 patients.\nMcLaren\u2019s Staricco said the Michigan hospital chain adopted its policy on use of blood thinners by looking at peers at Detroit Medical Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\nAs more institutions put their guidelines online, he said, there was \u201clots of copy-catting going on.\u201d (Reporting by Nick Brown in New York, Deena Beasley in Los Angeles, Gabriela Mello in S\u00e3o Paulo and Alexander Cornwell in Dubai.

Steel fences encircled the White House. Heavily armed officers met protesters with flash-bang grenades and chemical agents.\nThe bleak new look for the seat of American democracy last week came matched with rhetoric from President Donald Trump , who began publicly flirting with the idea of using active duty military to \"dominate\" and reclaim the streets from what he described as chaotic crowds in places not willing or able to contain the unrest.\nIn response to the president's threats to deploy military assets in a domestic setting, former military brass and departed Trump aides leveled a succession of pointed warnings. And lawmakers have sought reassurances that any future spike in violence or disease won't bring a military crackdown.\nEven though Trump has been prone to using fiery language for spectacle, and appears to have retreated from flexing about using more force, his critics maintain there are fresh reasons to worry. He could seek to further expand the boundaries of his power, they told ABC News, with several adding ominously that there are two words they fear most: martial law.\n\"This president has indicated no respect for limitations on his authority,\" U.S. Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent, told ABC News on Friday. \"What is he capable of? I think the answer is, pretty much anything.\"\nPresidents have imposed martial law -- giving military commanders the authority to make rules or take actions deemed necessary to restore order -- only rarely and in targeted ways over the course of the nation's history. The most striking example, during desegregation in the Deep South, was brief and limited. But taken to the extreme, the power could lead to the suppression of basic liberties, experts said.\nKing is one of several senators, most of them Democrats, who have written to the Trump administration in recent weeks seeking clarity on the president's intentions. He said he and others have not appreciated seeing Trump musing publicly about extending the limits of his authority.\nTrump and his administration have long floated an expansive approach to executive power, with the president arguing in a June 2019 interview with ABC News that Article II of the Constitution \"allows me to do whatever I want,\" and arguing this year that he has \"absolute immunity\" from subpoenas .\nIn 2017, Trump threatened to \"send in the feds\" to Chicago to quell violence there, and raised objections from critics that his deployment of troops to the Southern border to help with immigration control violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the law enforcement capacity of active duty military troops .\nTrump's flexing has grown more frequent since early spring, when the nation was beset by a pandemic and then by mass demonstrations around the country. During an April 14 White House briefing, on one of the darkest days of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump made his views on the subject clear by discussing his desire to overrule governors on reopening their states.\n\"When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total, and that's the way it's got to be,\" Trump said. \"It's total. Total.\"\nThough he dialed that rhetoric back the following day, concerns from the president's critics have only grown with the waves of protests and unrest that have followed the release of harrowing video showing Floyd dying with a Minneapolis police officer's knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\nIn addition to thousands marching and gathering peacefully across the country , there were also incidents of destruction and violence, with looters destroying storefronts, vandals setting fire to police cars and other buildings, and some attacking police officers and leading a police precinct in Minneapolis to be abandoned. Some states authorized the national guard to assist law enforcement, but others, like New York, did not. On May 28, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz began activating the states' national guard to provide support to local law enforcement in Minneapolis.\nDuring one White House speech last week, Trump declared his intent to enlist the military to quell outbreaks of violence by invoking the rarely-used Insurrection Act of 1807.\nAt that very moment, his aides had deployed military police from the D.C. National Guard and federal law to forcefully clear protesters from Lafayette Square, across from the White House, well before curfew, to enable him to pose for a photo with a bible in his hand at a neighboring historic church, damaged by fire amid the protests.\nThat move brought an unexpectedly sharp rebuke from a cast of retired military leaders, including the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Adm. Mike Mullen -- who served during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations -- Trump's former defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, and retired Gen. Martin Dempsey.\nDempsey told ABC's Martha Raddatz on \"This Week\" Sunday that he worried Trump's threat to deploy the military on U.S. streets \"would put the active duty military in a position where its relationship with the American people would be adversely affected.\"\nMattis was even more pointed, writing: \"We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.\"\nOne reason for the alarm, several legal\u00a0and constitutional scholars told ABC News, is that military control can be very hard to contain once the powers of civil control have been relinquished.\n\"There is no off switch,\" said Stephen Dycus, a professor at Vermont Law School, and the lead author of a casebook on the subject of executive power.\nNo precedents for martial law \nDycus said no modern president has moved to expand military power so broadly as to slide the nation toward martial law in peacetime -- where military authority overrules the nation's system of laws. But he worries about the potential response Trump may consider should the coronavirus resurge, or should civil unrest expand.\nOn Wednesday, Alan Dershowitz, one of President Trump's longtime personal advisers, took the unusual step of writing an opinion column in The Hill about the prospects of martial law, saying the nation has not reached the point where military force is justified.\n\"What then would the courts do if the president were to declare martial law and have the military detain protesters?\" he wrote. \"The answer here is clear. No one knows. There are no direct precedents for such an action when our nation is in peacetime.\"\nDershowitz wrote that martial law can be invoked by the president -- or by a military commander -- only when he or she thinks it is necessary to prevent a total breakdown in society.\n\"We are definitely not experiencing an invasion, nor do the current disturbances, violent as some but not others have been, qualify as a rebellion,\" Dershowitz wrote.\nThe same day, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked about the possibility martial law could be imposed in Washington, D.C., to protect historic monuments, and she replied, \"I have not heard that discussed.\"\nInside the White House, discussions about power \nInterpreting the words of President Trump can often be challenging. A showman with a knack for grabbing headlines, he has more than once breathed life into inflammatory notions -- like seeking a third term or threatening North Korea with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\" -- only to dial back his rhetoric in the days following.\nStill, he has also shown a frequent penchant for strongman tactics and imagery -- once promoting the idea of marching a military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue.\nAnd inside the White House, lawyers have quietly and vigorously been exploring the boundaries of presidential power and the extent to which it may be expanded, sources told ABC News.\nThose efforts intensified after the April briefing when Trump declared he had total authority to open states' economies and said he has seen \"numerous provisions\" that say as much. The president had not been shown anything by the White House lawyers that stated that, sources said at the time. Trump never acted on the threat.\nSince then, even as unsettling episodes of looting and unrest spread, the president never went so far as to consider anything approaching martial law, sources familiar with internal White House deliberations said.\nThe White House legal team rushed to prepare options ahead of the president's Rose Garden address one week ago. Conversations within the president's inner circle centered on domestic military options available to the commander in chief, senior administration officials said. One plan involved invoking the Insurrection Act, which permits the president to deploy armed forces to deal with civil disorder, as President George H.W. Bush did briefly during the 1992 civil unrest in Los Angeles.\nAttorney General Bill Barr cited his role advising President Bush to make this decision during the riots, during an interview with CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" Barr said he also believe the president would have the power to do so even if a governor of a particular state didn't request or approve the deployment, which he characterized as a \"last resort\" option.\nAs the week of unrest wore on, and violent clashes, and incidents of vandalism and looting began to wane, sources said the president began to cool to the idea. Ultimately, nearly one week after National Guard troops were deployed near the White House and around Washington, D.C., the president said on Sunday he ordered them withdrawn.\n\"I have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under perfect control,\" Trump tweeted Sunday, as peaceful protests in the nation's capital continued over the weekend. \"They will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed. Far fewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated!\"\nKing speculated that strong backlash to heavy-handed military tactics during those opening hours may have given Trump pause. \"I think response to what happened in Lafayette Square has been so overwhelming, the president is thinking twice,\" King said.\nHe and other Trump critics told ABC News they learned enough from the episode to ask more about the White House thinking in case conditions worsen in the fall.\nSecretive emergency plans \nWhile sources told ABC News that much of the legal work in the White House has centered on the response to coronavirus, and later the nationwide protests, one expert said there are longstanding blueprints for the president to assume more power during an emergency that date back to the Cold War and are revised periodically.\nThey are called the \"presidential emergency action documents,\" and they were the subject of a New York Times op-ed in April co-authored by Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\nGoitein said they consist of draft proclamations, executive orders and proposals for legislation that can be quickly deployed to assert broad presidential authority in a range of worst-case scenarios.\n\"They are one of the government's best-kept secrets,\" she wrote. \"No presidential emergency action document has ever been released or even leaked.\"\nGoitein said people only know of their existence because, over the years, officials have made passing references to them in other public statements and documents. In 1987, the Miami Herald reported that Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North had worked on some elements of the secret emergency plans with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nKing, who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said it is \"prudent and reasonable\" for any president to prepare for an emergency and have contingency plans drafted.\n\"But I'd like to know what they are and the circumstances under which they would be exercised,\" he said about the reported documents. He has written to the administration to seek copies.\nGoitein said she wrote about the secretive papers now for a reason.\nShe also noted the potential for a confluence of disruptive events that could strike this fall, especially if Trump has fallen behind in his reelection campaign.\n\"As polling comes out, if the economy suffers, if protests continue, if the virus resurges, he's going to feel backed into a corner,\" Goitein said.\n\"Emergency powers are dangerous, inherently,\" she said. \"I think people understand that they need to be in the hands of people who are responsible and coolheaded.\""}, {"RECORDID": "20200422-88948", "label": 0, "title": "Facebook bets on India with $5.7 billion Reliance deal | Reuters", "body": "By Sankalp Phartiyal , Nivedita Bhattacharjee\n5 Min Read\nNEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Facebook FB.O is set to spend $5.7 billion to buy a 9.99% stake in Reliance Industries' RELI.NS digital arm, as it looks to roll out services for India's grocers and small businesses by capitalizing on WhatsApp's extensive reach in the country.\nThe deal announced on Wednesday is Facebook\u2019s biggest since its $22 billion buyout of WhatsApp in 2014 and will give the Menlo Park, California-based firm a stake in Jio Platforms - the digital services entity that houses Reliance\u2019s telecoms arm Jio Infocomm, as well as its news, movie and music apps, along with other businesses.\nThe transaction is also the eighth largest deal in Asia this year based on deal value, according to Refinitiv data, and comes at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has stifled mergers and acquisitions activity globally.\nTo kick off the partnership, Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messenger, which counts India as its biggest market with about 400 million users, will help fuel the growth of Jio\u2019s new retail venture, JioMart, the two companies said.\n\u201cIn the near future JioMart ... and WhatsApp will empower nearly 30 million small Indian kirana (grocery) shops to digitally transact with every customer in their neighborhood,\u201d Mukesh Ambani, Reliance chairman and Asia\u2019s richest man, said in a video statement.\nJioMart, the e-commerce venture of Reliance's retail arm, offers customers free express grocery deliveries from neighborhood mum-and-pop stores. It is yet to be launched across India, and is likely to pose a formidable challenge to Amazon.com's AMZN.O local unit and Walmart's WMT.N Flipkart, which are also betting big on groceries to grow.\nFor Reliance, the deal will help the oil-to-retail group, which bet over $30 billion on the Jio telecoms venture, reduce its debt load.\nThe companies said the potential benefits of the deal were manifold, but shied away from giving details.\n\u201cWe will really look to explore multiple areas of collaboration,\u201d Ajit Mohan, the India head of Facebook, told journalists on a call. \u201cAnd the spirit of it will be - can we open new doors? Can we open new avenues?\u201d\nThe investment, according to tech and retail analysts, will give Facebook new means to expand in India, its biggest market outside of the United States.\nFacebook\u2019s offerings such as WhatsApp Business, which allows businesses to catalog products and send automated replies, and a payment service, could be handy tools for millions of small retailers and customers that Reliance wants to tie together.\nThe alliance with Jio, which has over 380 million subscribers, could also help WhatsApp evolve into an Indian version of Chinese internet giant Tencent's 0700.HK WeChat, which allows users to chat, make payments and book flights and hotels, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said.\n\u201cThe idea is to turn the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram ecosystem into something like that. What Facebook don\u2019t want to do is go out and deal with the physical task of building warehouses, keeping inventory. They don\u2019t want to be a Walmart or an Amazon,\u201d the source added, declining to be identified as details of the deal were private.\nThe perceived closeness between Reliance chairman Ambani - who has net worth of $49.2 billion, according to Forbes - and India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party could also ease Facebook\u2019s struggles in country which has taken Big Tech to task over issues such as misinformation and data privacy, sources said.\nWhatsApp\u2019s payments service has been awaiting regulatory clearances for nearly two years, and India has previously blamed WhatsApp for the spread of misinformation and fake news.\nFacebook\u2019s Mohan, however, played down the idea of the deal being aimed at smoothing regulatory issues, saying it was squarely focused on meeting the needs of small business owners.\nReliance has always pitched Jio as a technology company and it is using its financial muscle to build smart homes, which could rival Amazon\u2019s Alexa-based solutions, connected cars and security systems. For all of those, it could potentially tap into Facebook\u2019s tech prowess.\n\"They (Reliance) have great ambition. As they try to build a retail business on top of the core Jio base, this deal provides them with a mechanism for not having to go through a hit and trial method, but leverage some technologies that are proven,\" said Atul Kunwar, a former Chief Technology officer at one of India's biggest IT firms, Tech Mahindra TEML.NS .\nShares in Reliance ended 10% higher after rising as much as 12% earlier on the news, contributing nearly half the gains on the NSE Nifty 50 index on Wednesday.\nMorgan Stanley acted as financial adviser for Reliance, while AZB & Partners and Davis Polk & Wardwell acted as legal counsel. Facebook was advised by Bank of America.\n(This story corrects paragraph 2 to say Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, not Cupertino, California.)\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal in New Delhi and Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Bhargav Acharya and Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru, Nidhi Verma in New Delhi, Katie Paul in San Francisco, Sumeet Chatterjee and Sayantani Ghosh in Singapore; Editing by Edwina Gibbs, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200516-9640", "label": 1, "title": "Teva (TEVA) Q1 Earnings Top, Coronavirus-Led Buying Aids Sales", "body": "Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited TEVA reported first-quarter 2020 earnings of 76 cents per share, which significantly beat the consensus estimate of 59 cents. Earnings per share rose 26.7% year over year due to higher operating profit.\nRevenues of the generic drugmaker came in at $4.36 billion, which beat the consensus estimate of $4.15 billion. Sales rose 5% on both reported and constant currency terms year over year, mainly driven by double-digit sales growth in Europe.\nSales in the quarter benefited from greater demand in several markets for generic and OTC products and respiratory products amid the coronavirus-related lockdown.\nSegment Discussion\nTeva reports through the following segments based on three regions \u2014 North America (United States and Canada), Europe and International Markets.\nNorth America segment sales were $2.08 billion, up 2% year over year as higher sales of Austedo and Anda (distribution revenues) offset the impact of lower sales of branded drugs, Copaxone, Qvar and Bendeka/Treanda and generic drugs. In the United States, sales rose 2% to $1.94 billion.\nCopaxone posted sales of $198 million in North America, down 5% year over year due to generic erosion.\nCombined sales of Bendeka and Treanda declined 14% to $105 million due to lower volumes. The launch of a competing bendamustine solution called Belrapzo by Eagle Pharmaceuticals EGRX in June 2019 hurt volumes of Bendeka/Treanda.\nProAir sales rose 1% to $59 million. Qvar sales were $45 million in the quarter, down 29% due to lower volume and increased competition.\nAustedo, a new drug approved to treat chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease and tardive dyskinesia, recorded sales of $122 million in the quarter in North America compared with $136 million in the previous quarter. Teva said that sales of Austedo fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Fourth-quarter 2019 sales had benefited from particularly strong demand, which resulted in a sequential decline in first-quarter 2020. Sales are expected to grow in the rest of the year.\nAjovy, Teva\u2019s new migraine treatment, recorded sales of $29 million in the quarter compared with$25 million in the previous quarter.\nAjovy\u2019s weekly total prescription count in the United States has remained flat for many quarters. Management attributed the lower market share to preference of patients for auto injectors while Ajovy is available as a subcutaneous injection. Importantly, Teva\u2019s auto injector device for Ajovy is now approved in the United States and EU and was launched in the United States in late April, which could re-ignite growth in 2020.\nGeneric products revenues declined 1% to $952 million in the North America segment as higher sales from the launch of generic products including Truxima (Teva\u2019sbiosimilar to Roche\u2019s [RHHBY] Rituxan) and ProAir authorized generic were offset by price erosion and lower royalty income. Another biosimilar, Herzuma (biosimilar to Roche\u2019s Herceptin) was launched in March.\nDistribution revenues, generated by Anda, acquired from Allergan AGN in 2016, rose 13% in the quarter to $426 million as COVID-19 pandemic resulted in higher volumes in the quarter.\nThe Europe segment recorded revenues of $1.40 billion, up 11% (up 13% in constant currency terms) year over year, gaining from COVID-19 related patient stockpiling of generic and OTC medicines and continued growth in generics and generic product launch. However, these were partially offset by lower sales of Copaxone and oncology products due to generic competition. However sales of branded respiratory products rose in Europe due to COVID-19 related stockpiling.\nIn the International Markets segment, sales rose 8% (up 5% in constant currency terms) to $565 million as higher sales in Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Ukraine and Russia were partially offset by lower sales in Japan.\nThe Other segment (API manufacturing business and certain contract manufacturing services) recorded revenues of $307 million, down 2% year over year, in constant currency terms.\nCosts Decline, Margins Rise\nAdjusted gross margin rose 130 basis points (bps) to 53.1% in the quarter. Adjusted research & development expenses declined 13.3% year over year to $221 million due to pipeline optimization. Selling and marketing (S&M) expenditure declined 5.3% from the year-ago level to $570 million due to cost-cutting activities and lower marketing and travel costs due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions. General and administrative (G&A) expenses rose 3.6% year over year to $290 million. Adjusted operating income rose 22% in the quarter to $1.24 billion due to higher profits in all three segments, some economic hedging activities and lower S&M costs.\n2020 Guidance\nTeva maintained its previously issued guidance for 2020. It expects revenues to be in the range of $16.6-$17.0 billion. Earnings are expected in the band of $2.30-2.55 per share.\nIn 2020, Teva expects global Copaxone sales of approximately $1.2 billion, $300 million lower than in 2019. While Austedo is expected to record sales of $650 million, Ajovy is expected to bring in $250 million in global sales.\nFree cash flow is expected in the range of $1.8-$2.2 billion.\nOur Take\nTeva\u2019s first-quarter results were strong as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Despite the solid first-quarter performance, the company maintained its outlook for the year as it expects a significant impact from the COVID-19 in the second quarter, which may offset the first-quarter outperformance. Its stock was up more than 10% on Thursday. Teva share price has risen 17.9% this year so far against the industry\u2019s decrease of 3.7%.\nTeva faces challenges in the form of generic erosion of Copaxone, new competition for branded products, pricing erosion in the U.S. generics business, currency headwinds and a massive debt load. Nonetheless, its two-year restructuring plan was successful, leading to $3 billion in cost savings by 2019. Its newest drugs Austedo and Ajovy could emerge as significant drivers of long-term sales growth. With encouraging progress on restructuring activities, stabilization in U.S. and European generics business and improvement in financials, we believe the company may return to growth in 2020.\nTeva, however, is involved in an opioid litigation and faces DOJ investigations on allocations of price fixing, which are overhangs on its stock. Teva faces several lawsuits, which claim that it is one of the several companies whose opioid-based drugs were responsible for fueling nationwide opioid epidemic.\nCurrently, Teva has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The peak will be bad. People will lose their lives.\u201d\nThe mayor also rebuffed President Trump\u2019s earlier comments suggesting restrictions might be eased quickly and said that Angelenos should be \u201cprepared for a couple months like this.\u201d\n\u201cI know that everybody is hopeful, and some are putting out that hope of us being back in churches by Easter or synagogues by Passover, of restarting the economy in a couple weeks,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cI think we owe it to everybody to be straightforward and honest that we will not be back to that [level of] normal in that short period of time.\u201d\nGarcetti's warning came on the same day that Los Angeles County confirmed four more deaths linked to the novel coronavirus on Tuesday, including what might be the first fatality of a person younger than 18.\nThe number of deaths in the county from the virus is now 11. Tuesday's update also included a previously reported death in Long Beach.\nHours after announcing the juvenile's death Tuesday, county heath officials issued a clarification that the death \"will require further evaluation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"\n\"Though early tests indicated a positive result for COVID-19, the case is complex and there may be an alternate explanation for this fatality. Patient privacy prevents our offering further details at this time,\" officials said.\nThe young victim, a teenager from Lancaster, died of septic shock, Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris told The Times. The teen's father contracted the virus, Parris said.\n\"The father had close contact on the job with the public daily,\" the mayor said. \"This is truly awful, to lose a child.\"\nIn response, Parris said, he is asking that all children stay indoors, and is working to secure 100,000 test kits.\n\"They aren't testing hardly anybody,\" Parris said. \"So we aren't going to wait for the county. We are going to provide our own tests.\"\nTwo of the people who died were between the ages of 50 and 70. One had underlying health issues and resided in the West Adams neighborhood, health officials said.\n\"This is a devastating reminder that COVID-19 affects people of all ages,\" L.A. County Public Health Department Director Barbara Ferrer said.\nThe Public Health Department said it was working to confirm whether the case marks the first such death of a minor linked to coronavirus in the country. Garcetti said he was informed by county officials that the Lancaster teen did not have any preexisting conditions.\nAuthorities also confirmed an additional 128 cases of coronavirus infection, bringing the county's total to 662. Of those, 42% are people ages 18 to 40, and 39% are people 41 to 65.\nAt least 119 residents, or 18% of all positive cases in the county, have been hospitalized for the virus.\nAt his news conference Tuesday afternoon, Garcetti said that his office is still receiving daily reports of nonessential businesses that continue to operate as normal \u2014 behavior he called \"irresponsible and selfish.\u201d\nHe announced a Safer at Home business ambassadors initiative that aims to help push greater adherence from nonessential businesses to the city\u2019s order to close. Businesses that ignore the order should also expect to get a warning call from prosecutors before the city takes more aggressive action, including turning off their water and power, the mayor said.\n\u201cThe easiest way to avoid a visit from the city is to follow the rules,\u201d Garcetti said.\nThe city has not cited any nonessential businesses so far, according to a spokesperson for the mayor's office. The total number of complaints filed was not available.\nThere are 40 business ambassadors assigned to enforcement of the nonessential business order. Residents can report scofflaws here .\nIn Orange County, officials announced 27 new cases, bringing the total to 152 . The county's first death was reported Tuesday.\nSan Mateo County saw a jump of 19 new cases, pushing its total to 161, and its second fatality. The number of cases increased by more than 10% in one day, according to Preston Merchant, a public information officer working in the county's joint information center.\nThe latest death was of a resident at the Atria Senior Living facility in Burlingame, which learned on March 15 that a number of residents had tested positive. Monday's fatality was the first of a resident related to the coronavirus.\n\"Our thoughts are with their family during this difficult time,\" Atria said in a statement. \"We remain in close communication with all our residents and their families and continue to provide our support as we navigate this unprecedented situation together.\"\nAtria said it was working closely with the San Mateo County Health Department, and officials have been on site to confirm proper health and safety measures are in place.\nThe number of coronavirus cases in California surged to nearly 2,50 0 Tuesday afternoon  and the death toll climbed to at least 51 as officials issued urgent warnings about the need for more hospital beds and equipment as medical facilities begin to fill up.\nGov. Gavin Newsom says he believes California will need 50,000 hospital beds for patients suffering from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. That marks a significant increase from the 20,000 beds his administration forecast last week. The Democratic governor said the state\u2019s 416 hospitals were doubling their \"surge plans,\" a move that will result in 30,000 new beds across the system.\nSan Francisco officials warned that a surge in coronavirus infections was expected to come within a week or two, and voiced dismay over images of the public crowding beaches and parks across California.\n\u201cThe worst is yet to come,\u201d Dr. Grant Colfax, San Francisco's director of public health, said at a news conference Monday.\nSan Francisco has already taken steps to decompress the healthcare system \u2014 banning almost all visitors to hospitals and long-term-care facilities, canceling elective surgeries and routine medical visits, ordering that appointments be done by phone or video if possible, and opening up tents to care for patients who have mild symptoms in order to keep hospital beds free for those more seriously ill.\nA steep rise in people being hospitalized with COVID-19 in Los Angeles County probably signals the approach of a wave of extremely sick patients that could overwhelm hospitals in the coming weeks , experts say.\nAs of March 6, five people in the county had been hospitalized at some point with COVID-19. Two weeks later, on Friday, that figure had jumped to 48. By Monday, the total had climbed to 90.\nThough the raw numbers remain relatively low, the rate of increase has set many doctors and nurses on edge after watching the disease\u2019s alarming trajectory in China, Italy and, most recently, New York City.\nIn Long Beach, Mayor Robert Garcia tweeted Tuesday that the city is now up to 28 confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\"If you have the ability to stay home, please do so,\" Garcia wrote. \"Wash your hands and social distance. We all need to work to flatten the curve.\"\nArt Marroquin, spokesman for the city's joint information center, said Long Beach's 28 cases include one of two Cal State Long Beach students who tested positive for the virus and were in self-isolation off campus. The student was included because they are a Long Beach resident.\nOne student had not been on campus for two weeks, the university said. In the second case, public health officials determined there was no opportunity for on-campus exposure. Students who might have come into close contact with the patients were being notified by health officials, according to the email.\nAs the number of cases continues to rise, officials throughout the state kept up their call for an increase in testing capacity and reporting.\nFrustrated public health directors in six Bay Area counties have ordered an assortment of commercial, university and pop-up testing sites that are screening residents for COVID-19 to begin reporting not just the positive cases, but the negative results too.\nDr. Sara Cody said testing remains woefully inadequate as Santa Clara County wrestles with mounting deaths. As of Tuesday, 16 people had died in the county, more than half of the virus fatalities in California.\nThe Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office confirmed four cases among its staff, including a deputy who is self-isolating at home.\nCalifornia requires labs and hospitals to report known cases of COVID-19, but not the number of negative tests. Cody said that information is critical to tracking the spread of the virus. She warned that Santa Clara County's current critical situation is a window into what will be seen in San Francisco and other Bay Area communities in the next one to two weeks.\nContra Costa County is one of the six counties that ordered new requirements. On Friday, health officer Chris Farnitano said the county would issue an order for negative tests to be reported as well.\nMeanwhile, California remains largely shut down under state and local orders. L.A. County officials have cracked down on nonessential businesses, which Sheriff Alex Villanueva declared Tuesday includes gun stores . If gun sellers don\u2019t close their doors, he said, they will be cited and face penalty, including the loss of their business licenses.\nOfficials previously closed beach parking lots, parks and hiking trials amid concerns some people were not staying at least six feet apart while in public. Laguna Beach took the restrictions a step further and closed its beaches entirely on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, Los Angeles City Councilman David Ryu called for the closure of Runyon Canyon Park and Lake Hollywood Park on weekends.\n\u201cMaking this request pains me greatly. I grew up in a two-bedroom apartment off the 101 Freeway, and our city\u2019s parks were my only access to outdoor space,\u201d Ryu said of his recommendation to Michael Shull, the general manager of the city\u2019s Department of Recreation and Parks. \u201cI don\u2019t make this recommendation easily, but closing Runyon Canyon Park on weekends, when we have seen the highest volume of visitors, should follow to keep everyone safe.\u201d\nIn Sonoma County, all parks and open spaces were closed indefinitely, public health officials announced this week.\nThe closure includes city, county, state and federal parklands and recreational lands operated by private groups and nonprofits, according to a news release.\n\u201cClosing parks is a difficult decision, but it is the right decision at this time,\u201d Sundari Mase, the county\u2019s interim health officer, said in a statement. \u201cAllowing crowded conditions in parks is not in our best interest during this health crisis. The best action we can take is to stay close to home and limit our outdoor time to our yards and neighborhoods.\"\nMase announced the closure Monday after too many visitors flocked to outdoor spaces over the weekend.\nCriminal and civil trials were discontinued in California for at least two months after a sweeping order was issued late Monday by the state\u2019s chief justice that aimed to sharply reduce public traffic in state courthouses.\nChief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye said in her order that court facilities were \u201cill-equipped to effectively allow the social distancing and other public health requirements\u201d that had been imposed across California to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\u201cEven if court facilities could allow for sufficient social distancing, the closure of schools means that many court employees, litigants, witnesses, and potential jurors cannot leave their homes to attend court proceedings because they must stay home to supervise their children,\u201d Cantil-Sakauye said in the order.\nThe 60-day delay \u2014 which puts the courts in California\u2019s 58 counties on a uniform trial delay schedule \u2014 came the same day that the presiding judge of Los Angeles County Superior Court, Kevin C. Brazile, blocked public access to county courthouses except for attorneys, staff, defendants and \u201cauthorized persons,\u201d a vague category that includes news reporters. The clerk\u2019s office will still be available to accept filings and assist people by phone or electronically.\nThe California National Guard on Monday provided details about how personnel would be deployed across the state to assist in coronavirus aid. Officials said the guard was being used purely for humanitarian purposes, such as distributing food and medical supplies as well as helping at food banks and working with officials on the Grand Princess cruise ship, which docked in California after an outbreak of the virus on board.\nWith the coronavirus pandemic further stifling the efforts of California and other states to issue Real ID licenses , President Trump on Monday said he would extend the Oct. 1 deadline for people to apply for the identification cards to board domestic flights in the United States.\nTimes staff writers

anti-corruption protests that have been roiling in the streets of the Bulgarian capital Sofia for the past six weeks have united people from across the country and all walks of life.\nThe faces of the protesters are as diverse as the country itself and they all share one aim: forcing the resignation of conservative Prime Minister Boyko Borisov as a first step to cleaning up public life.\n- The man who lit the fuse -\nAn inflatable boat had a starring role in sparking the wave of protests last month when Hristo Ivanov landed the craft on a beach on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast.\nWhile the beach is ostensibly public, in reality access is controlled by a well-connected lawmaker, and a fracas soon played out between Ivanov and the politician's security.\nThe bearded, blue-shirted Ivanov says the incident was the final straw for many Bulgarians.\n\"Before people voted with their feet and left if they didn't see a future in Bulgaria,\" says Ivanov, who was himself a minister in a previous Borisov government before starting his own anti-corruption party.\nThose who have had to return because of the pandemic \"cannot tolerate the arrogant impunity of the 'untouchable' elite,\" he says in front of a protest camp between the presidency and government headquarters.\n- The telegenic activist -\nOne of the faces Bulgarians have become most used to during the protests is telegenic 48-year-old lawyer Nikolay Hadjigenov, who can often be seen addressing demonstrators.\nFrustrated with what he saw as the prevailing lethargy in Bulgaria, he and two friends became an activist trio who throw out suggestions for new protest actions.\nThe group has coordinated street blockades, traffic go-slows, even tomato-throwing at certain politicians -- anything to try to keep momentum going.\n\"We have lit a spark and for the first time civil society is emerging in Bulgaria,\" he tells AFP with a smile.\nThe trio also publicised a protest at the German embassy.\n\"EU funds are being syphoned off under their noses and they are pretending not to notice,\" he says, pointing out that Borisov's party belongs to the powerful centre-right European People's Party (EPP) grouping.\nThe EPP also counts German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as a member.\n- The hacked-off mother\u00a0-\nSeeing news reports about oligarchs' luxury villas brought home to 50-year-old Vera Ivanova how wide the gulf was between their life and her own.\nThe mother of a 25-year-old disabled son, Vera has been in the streets demanding the removal of an elite she says has \"stolen\" her life.\nThe 420 leva (211 euros) that the two of them receive per month are \"just enough to make ends meet\", she sighs.\nShe says she can't afford the renovations to her house needed to accommodate her son, who has cerebral palsy.\n\"Mothers are hostages and don't have any choice but to leave work\" in order to care for their children, says Ivanova, sporting a black T-shirt with the name of the NGO she co-founded with other mothers: \"The System Is Killing Us.\"\nThe health and social care systems are in urgent need of reform and \"corrupt to the core,\" she says.\n- The determined businessman -\nGeorgi Georgiev, 47, is a small business owner from the country's north-west, the most deprived region of what is anyway the European Union's poorest country.\nIt is precisely those areas that are most in need of EU development funds, but many residents complain they never see the benefit of the cash.\nGeorgiev blames entrenched corruption.\n\"We have to get rid of this mafia and create a civil society which will be more vigilant towards the next leaders,\" he tells AFP on Sofia's iconic Eagles' Bridge, the focal point for many of the protests.\nHe has become part of a group of protesters who will brook no compromise with Borisov's government.\nThey comprise NGO workers, lawyers, IT experts and others who have created a space to exchange ideas which they compare to the famous Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park.\nvs/jsk/tgb/gle"}, {"RECORDID": "20200711-46946", "label": 0, "title": "Manila Zoo sets up urban garden to feed animals", "body": "MANILA, Philippines \u2014 The administration of the Manila Zoo in Malate has come up with a self-sustaining way to feed its herbivore or plant-eating animals amid the uncertain times brought about by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe zoo management converted an idle 200-square meter lot previously used for horseback riding into an urban garden.\nWith the zoo shuttered to the public since January last year, compounded by a community quarantine that shut down public parks and hampered supply deliveries, the zoo management had to come up with a way to grow its own food for its animals and personnel.\nAccording to Manila Zoo\u2019s officer-in-charge Alipio Morabe Jr., the seedlings were provided by the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Bureau of Plant Industry and uses the zoo animals\u2019 manure as fertilizer.\nThey started the project last April, and this month their labors bore fruit, with a bountiful harvest that supplied food for the herbivores \u2013 species of birds, carabao or water buffaloes, rabbits, zebras and elephants.\n\u201cWe were worried that we would be short of food for the animals. I was worried for our herbivore animals, so we thought of using the animals\u2019 dung for the garden, and within a month, the plants started to sprout,\u201d Morabe told The STAR.\nAmong the fruits and vegetables grown in the zoo garden are ampalaya (bitter gourd), okra, eggplant, alugbati, mustasa (mustard), patola (silk squash or ribbed loofah), upo (bottle gourd) and kalabasa (squash).\nThe manure of the zoo\u2019s only elephant Mali, who has lived in the zoo for over 40 years, was also used as fertilizer. The gardener was surprised that watermelons and melons, which no one planted, sprouted from Mali\u2019s dung.\n\u201cSprouts of melon and watermelon came out of Mali\u2019s manure because she had been eating the two fruits,\u201d Morabe said of Mali.\nIn May, Morabe assured the public that Mali is fed with nutritious food twice a day and given vitamins to ensure that she is protected against diseases, including COVID-19.\nSeveral animal rights groups have called for the release of Mali, saying the animal has been kept captive from her home country Sri Lanka for more than four decades.\nThe zoo administrator\u2019s fears for the animals\u2019 welfare during the quarantine period prompted the management to be self-sufficient in its food, Morabe said.\n\u201cWe need to be self-sufficient now. Because the supply is bountiful, even the people of the zoo share in the food, but of course the animals are the priority,\u201d he added.\nManila Mayor Isko Moreno supported the zoo\u2019s urban garden during the pandemic, Morabe said. The mayor has also supported the renovation of the zoo, which first opened to the public on July 25, 1959.\nIn January 2019, then Manila mayor Joseph Estrada ordered the temporary closure of the zoo to allow the Office of the City Administrator and the city\u2019s Department of Engineering and Public Works to conduct a \u201cproper study and assessment.\u201d This was after Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu tagged the zoo\u2019s sewage as a major pollutant of Manila Bay, with the zoo\u2019s untreated sewage being drained into one of the bay\u2019s estuaries.\nThe zoo has remained shut since then. When Moreno took over in 2019, he vowed to renovate the zoo and make it family- and animal-friendly.\nThe city government is working on improving the zoo with glass barriers to separate visitors and the animals when it reopens by late 2021, Morabe said. A fishing lake is also being developed.\nPart of the renovation blueprint of the city government is a thesis by University of Santo Tomas architecture student Kevin Siy for the redevelopment of the zoo to make it closer to the animals\u2019 natural habitat.\nIn Siy\u2019s design, Mali will have a bigger pen with loam sand to cushion her feet. She is currently kept inside a concrete enclosure.\nMorabe said the renovated Manila Zoo will be open to the public next year with better and more spacious facilities for the animals as well as a sewage treatment plant."}, {"RECORDID": "20200627-20402", "label": 1, "title": "Martin named new Irish prime minister, vows to tackle deep recession | Reuters", "body": "By Padraic Halpin\n4 Min Read\nDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland\u2019s parliament picked veteran opposition leader Miche\u00e1l Martin as prime minister on Saturday to head the first coalition uniting the two parties that have battled each other for power since a civil war nearly a century ago.\nHe pledged to rescue Ireland from the \u201cthe fastest-moving recession ever to hit\u201d, brought on by the coronavirus crisis.\nMartin\u2019s Fianna Fail party was forced to join forces with its foes Fine Gael, after a surprise election surge for leftist Irish nationalists Sinn Fein left neither of the traditional centrist parties with enough support to govern on its own.

It has 37 seats in the 160-seat parliament, the same number as Fianna Fail and two more than Fine Gael.\n\u201cYou will no longer get it all your own way,\u201d Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald told the two parties.\nAdditional reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Louise Heavens and Alison Williams\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200326-31407", "label": 0, "title": "Prince Charles Did Not Jump the Queue for a Coronavirus Test, Says UK", "body": "Britain on Thursday said heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, who has coronavirus, did not jump the queue for a test because his symptoms and condition met the criteria.\nCharles, 71, tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week but is in good health and is now self-isolating at his residence in Scotland with mild symptoms along with his wife Camilla, who tested negative, his office said.\nThe prince, who is in good spirits, was working at his desk as usual on Thursday, a royal source said.

It is owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp.\nThe captain announced the deaths to passengers and crew Friday afternoon, along with news that two passengers have tested positive for COVID-19. He also stated the company planned to evacuate hundreds of healthy passengers to a sister ship anchored nearby.\nThe Zaandam originally left Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 with 1,243 passengers and 586 crew on board for a two-week cruise. It anchored off the coast of Panama Friday, awaiting permission to pass through the canal and potentially berth in Port Everglades. It was turned away from its original destination, Chile, on March 21.\nBut the Panamanian government told reporters the ship would not be allowed to pass through if anyone on board had a confirmed case of COVID-19.\n\u201cIf there are confirmed cases of COVID-19, the ship has to go into quarantine,\u201d the administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, Ricaurte V\u00e1squez, told Telemetro Reporta . \u201cIf there are elements of contagion, the ship has to go into quarantine. That is not an alternative or an option.\u201d\nIn response, HAL Spokesman Erik Elvejord said in a statement, \u201cWhile the onward plan for both ships is still being finalized, we continue to work with the Panamanian authorities on approval to transit the Panama Canal for sailing to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\u201d\nFriday afternoon, the Panama Canal Authority doubled down with a statement that no ship with a COVID-positive individual on board may cross the canal.\n\u201cAll ships transiting the Panama Canal require personnel, including line handlers, boarding officers, and Panama Canal pilots, to board the ship throughout the transit in order to ensure a safe passage throughout the waterway. These protocols are in place to safeguard our customers and workforce,\u201d the statement read.\nFamily members of passengers aboard were alarmed by the news of a potential quarantine off the coast of Panama. Lisa Marion, a Toronto-area woman whose parents are on the ship, called it \u201ca nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that the longer they stay at sea, the more likely they are to catch COVID-19.

On Sunday, that number was 42.\n\u201cI wish the U.S. would offer additional help, quicker help,\u201d said Anna Marie Carton, a passenger aboard the Zaandam from Louis Park, Minnesota. She and her fiance are anxious to head home to their children.\nEarlier this week, Holland America Line sent a sister ship, the Rotterdam, to aid the Zaandam. The additional ship was originally meant to bring medical supplies, personnel and COVID-19 tests, but the company has since decided to transfer hundreds of passengers from the Zaandam to the Rotterdam in what it calls a \u201chumanitarian mission.\u201d\nThe company said it will only transfer healthy patients who show no symptoms, starting with people in interior cabins and those over the age of 70, but it won\u2019t be testing the passengers it transfers, according to a company press release. This has alarmed crew members aboard the Rotterdam, who are terrified of importing the illness to a ship with more than 600 crew aboard.\n\u201cIs it humanitarian to do this to the Rotterdam crew, that is here to support their families? Has anyone paused to think what is Holland America Line going to tell their parents, children, when they get infected and eventually die? Are they not seeing the news?\u201d said a crew member aboard the Rotterdam who asked for anonymity out of fear of retaliation. \u201cWho cares!? After all is crew members who are sent to slaughter!!!!\u201d\nThe crew member also provided the Miami Herald with a document circulated by the company to Rotterdam crew answering frequently asked questions about the transfer of passengers to their ship. Many of the questions focus on the possibility of bringing the coronavirus along with the passengers; the answers downplay the risk to crew members, noting that many of them recently took shore leave.\n\u201cThe trip ashore actually posed a higher risk than what we are suggesting with the transfer of healthy guests from Zaandam to Rotterdam. Catching a flight is now considered a high-risk exposure while serving healthy guests in isolation without any physical contact is considered a very low risk operation,\u201d the FAQ said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said cruise ships are a veritable petri dish for coronavirus spread.\nThe FAQ document also said that there is little risk because passengers have already been isolated for five to six days and people with COVID-19 usually show symptoms \u201cin about three to five days,\u201d which is incorrect. The CDC says infected people can show symptoms anytime between two and 14 days, and some people contract the disease without showing any symptoms at all.\nOne question on the document read: \u201dIf we do get a COVID-19 case on board, won\u2019t we have created now two ships with trouble?\u201d\n\u201cWe believe this is a very low probability,\u201d the answer read. \u201cWe should be able to fully prevent anything from spreading throughout the vessel while moving back up North.\u201d\nThat attitude is not shared by passengers on board the Zaandam, even those who feel fine and hope to secure a spot on the other ship.\n\u201cWe all know those going over to the Rotterdam could have the virus and spread it there,\u201d said Cliff Kolber, a 72-year-old Miramar man on board the ship with his wife, who was reached by phone.\nThe FAQ explains that guests will be transferred from ship to ship via a \u201csecure corridor\u201d that will be \u201csuper\u201d sanitized ahead of time.\nIn answer to a question about whether ship has even personal protective equipment \u2014 such as masks and gloves \u2014 aboard, the crew document said, \u201cteam who need PPE for a particular job they are doing will be provided it to wear based on their individual risk.\u201d The document states that crew serving food to guests will not be given PPE because \u201cthere will not be direct exposure to the guests.\u201d\nAnother answer on the document said that if crew has to enter the cabin, they will be given protective gear.\nThe FAQ explains that only guests with no symptoms will be transferred over, but said they will not be tested beforehand because \u201ctesting well people is not advised by any health experts.\u201d The company only plans to use test kits to confirm whether COVID-19 is on board and causing the illness. It does not specifically answer the question of whether tests will be available for crew.\nAn isolated crew member aboard the Zaandam, who wished to remain anonymous, said the ship\u2019s doctor said they would not be tested for COVID-19, despite showing symptoms earlier in the week.\n\u201cWe went from not having a worry in the world as medical had been conducting temperature checks on all guests, to complete lock down and isolation in a matter of hours,\u201d the crew member wrote in a message. \u201cIt is concerning staying onboard for another two weeks as we have seen how quickly it spreads.\u201d\nSeveral questions on the FAQ clearly show that the Rotterdam crew\u2019s anxiety is well known by superiors.\nIn answer to a question about what happens if someone isn\u2019t comfortable servicing cabins with food or laundry, the FAQ said \u201cnobody will be pushed to do something that doesn\u2019t feel right to them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do we need to do this?\u201d is one of the first questions listed.\n\u201cThere is no other place for us to take the guests and no other means to provide assistance to the Zaandam and our fellow team members on board. This is the only option, as the ports and airports in South America and Central America are closed to us,\u201d the document reads.\nSome family members said they wish the company had just canceled the cruise altogether like other lines did around the same time.\n\u201cMy parents only went because it wasn\u2019t canceled,\u201d said Marion. \u201cIt was also one of those things where you think \u2018I\u2019ve saved up so long for this, and the governments are telling me its ok to travel, so I guess I\u2019ll get on the boat\u2019.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a92020 Miami Herald\nVisit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}, {"RECORDID": "20200715-20171", "label": -1, "title": "Premarket stocks: US banks warn of much more economic pain ahead", "body": "The biggest US banks are setting aside billions of dollars to deal with toxic loans as support from the government falls off in the months ahead, a sign that some of the worst economic damage from the pandemic is still to come.\nAAPL\nSTZ\nTSLA\nAMZN\nWhat's happening: JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo said Tuesday that they earmarked nearly $28 billion to cover credit losses last quarter, wiping out a huge chunk of profits made between April and June.\nJPMorgan, the largest US bank, reported a 51% plunge in second-quarter profit, citing the need to prepare for \"increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook.\" Wells Fargo reported its first quarterly loss since the Great Recession.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Jennifer Piepszak said much of the pain of the recession is still to come for banks as massive government stimulus efforts begin to taper off.\n\"May and June are really the easy months in terms of what this recovery will look like,\" Piepszak said on a call with reporters.

In the long run it could reduce revenue and cause bad loans to rise as supply chains are disrupted, Quinn said.\nThe virus has killed almost 1,900 people, overwhelmingly in mainland China, and infected more than 70,000, while its economic impact is spreading across the globe.\nHSBC veteran Quinn is auditioning for the permanent role of CEO, which the bank said in August would be announced within six to 12 months.\n\u201cIn one sense, they are doing the things that were obvious and had been called out by many, so it\u2019s good,\u201d Hugh Young, managing director at Aberdeen Asset Managemement Asia, one of HSBC\u2019s 20 largest investors said.\n\u201cGetting this done will require a fair amount of work, then we need to see how it settles down. Noel is doing a good job in very difficult circumstances,\u201d he added.\nEurope\u2019s biggest bank by assets, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, said profit before tax tumbled by a third to $13.35 billion in 2019, far below the average estimate of $20.03 billion from brokerages compiled by the bank.\nThat was due to $7.3 billion in write-offs linked to its global banking and markets and commercial banking business units in Europe.\nIn the United States, where the bank has underperformed for years, HSBC said it would close around a third of its 224 branches and target only international and wealthier clients.\nThe lender\u2019s shares were down 3.7 percent at 568 pence at the London market open.\nHSBC, which has bought back some $6 billion of its own shares since 2016, said it would suspend buybacks for two years in order to pay for the restructuring but would maintain its dividend.\nThe bank\u2019s return on tangible equity (RoTE), a key profitability measure, is expected to be in the range of 10% to 12% in 2022. HSBC reported a RoTE of 8.4% for last year, down from 8.6% in 2018.\nHSBC said it planned to invest more than $100 billion in \u201chigher returning areas\u201d, resulting in broadly flat assets in value terms over the three years. It also expects to incur restructuring costs of about $6 billion, the bulk of it in this year and the next.\nWhile strengthening its investment banking capabilities in Asia and the Middle East, the bank will maintain a global investment banking hub in London, reducing its European footprint for the business.\nThe bank will also reduce its sales and research coverage in European cash equities with a focus on supporting equity capital market transactions, it said, confirming a Reuters report last month regarding pullback from the trading business.\nCommenting on the impact of the coronavirus, Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters the bank expected additional loan loss provisions in the first quarter.\nReporting by Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong and Lawrence White in London; Additional reportng by Anshuman Daga in Singapore; Editing by Edwina Gibbs, Sinead Cruise and John Stonestreet\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200903-62851", "label": 1, "title": "Tilda Swinton exudes glamour at the Venice Film Festival", "body": "She was recently honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award on the opening night of the Venice Film Festival.\nAnd Tilda Swinton looked every inch the film star as she walked the red carpet for the premiere of The Human Voice and\u00a0Quo Vadis, Aida? in Venice on Thursday.\nThe actress, 59, displayed her sense of style as she donned a white long-sleeved dress with a high collar.\nThe garment also featured a detailed embroidered floral print while Tilda added height to her frame with a pair of green heels.\nTilda carried a gold Venetian mask with her as she walked the red carpet at the glamorous event.\nThe Avengers star completed her look for the event by styling her strawberry blonde locks into a dramatic quiff.\nTilda was joined on the red carpet by The Human Voice director Pedro Almodovar.\nThe film centres one woman (played by Tilda) and final phone conversation with her longtime lover, who has plans to marry another woman.\nIt comes after Tilda honoured the late actor Chadwick Boseman as she accepted an award at the festival by proclaiming 'Wakanda forever' on stage on Wednesday.\nThe star was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award and\u00a0proudly held her coveted trophy aloft after receiving the honour at the opening ceremony from Cate Blanchett, who heads this year's jury.\nAt the end of her acceptance speech, Tilda gave a nod to her fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe star Chadwick as she said: 'Viva Venezia.

It is now more urgent than ever to have the proper framework that would allow for effective collaboration among all stakeholders in the food supply chain. Blockchain technology, known as the \"Trust Machine\", is the best choice at hand.\nAs the world's leading enterprise-friendly public blockchain platform and company, VeChain officially launches its market ready, blockchain-enabled food safety solution based on its one-stop data Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform VeChain ToolChain \u2122 .\nThe solution allows blockchain technology to be deployed in the food sector with the fastest lead time compared with any other platform in the industry. The VeChain ToolChain \u2122 powered Food Safety Solution integrates VeChain's industry-leading technology and experience with business-ready technical features, solving the most urgent needs for the food industry in this new era.\nBlockchainizing The Food Sector In The \"New Normal\"\nConcerns about food safety have been brought to the forefront following the coronavirus outbreak. Consumer behavior changes due to COVID-19 have brought higher demands for safe and traceable food products. According to an IBM study , 71% of consumers are willing to pay an additional average premium of 37% for companies offering full transparency and traceability.\nBlockchain technology is well positioned to tackle the current problems as it provides Immutable Trustworthy Data . Immutable trustworthy data is the critical component to allow for transparency, accountability and most importantly trust among all participants within the supply chain from the raw supplier to the end consumer.\nSome examples where this can be applied would be in the event of food recall requiring strict data points for compliance or the need for a company to easier manage multiple suppliers through tamper resistant data gathering.\nIn addition, a recent report by Cointelegraph Consulting took a closer look on the transformation that is taking place in the food industry by governments and stakeholders and how \"Blockchain + IoT\" solutions could significantly lower the cost for the global food industry:\nIoT & blockchain platforms can increase trust, transparency and coordination throughout the food supply chain, resulting in $155 billion per year in potential savings.\nA better traceability will boost the international food trade by over  $100 million per year.\nIoT & blockchain solutions can create up to $47 billion per year in revenue enhancement.\nIn short, together with the deployment of IoT devices to collect the data, blockchain technology can streamline business processes and enable companies to stand out in a crowded market while setting common standards that will shape the supply chains of the future.\nVeChain ToolChain \u2122 Enables Rapid Deployment Of Blockchain Technology For Enterprises\nAlthough many businesses have been trying to implement blockchain technology into their current business, many barriers to entry hinder such implementation. For example, businesses are often forced to build their own blockchain applications from scratch and grapple with the complexities associated with the technology.\nMost BaaS platforms and companies in the market provide only assistance for the companies of high level framework services (such as deployment of nodes). This massive barrier of entry hinders the adoption of blockchain in the food sector. With VeChain ToolChain \u2122 , ready-to-use blockchain applications can be deployed and implemented quickly to solve real business needs.\nVeChain positions itself as the enabler to drive technology implementation that would bring tangible business value for enterprises. By using built-in, ready-to-use templates modelled after countless already deployed solutions by enterprise clients, every food enterprise can achieve full lifecycle traceability for their supply chains, covering from farm to retail and the customer's hand. Traceability can start from cultivation, processing, packaging, logistics, to retail and more.\nValue Proposition of VeChain ToolChain \u2122 for Businesses\nThe VeChain ToolChain \u2122 powered food safety solution is characterized by its high standardization, light cost and flexible payment in the market. Most importantly, VeChain ToolChain TM also offers customizable tools and whitelabel services, where consultant companies can obtain and implement the Food Safety Management Service for their own clients.\nThe main value proposition of VeChain ToolChain \u2122 includes:\nValue 1: Enable Enterprises To Introduce And Complete Blockchain Proof-of-concepts Efficiently. The blockchain-enabled food safety solution powered by VeChain ToolChain \u2122 can provide food industry enterprises with various traceability templates that have been effectively verified, including origin traceability, cross-border traceability, full-process traceability, and more.\nThe solution covers a wide variety of use cases and sub-sectors in the F&B industry, including fresh food, dairy products, alcohol and wine, imported food, FMCG for supermarkets and retail, and more. Companies can quickly carry out concept verification at little to no lead time and experience the full potential of blockchain technology for their respective sub-sectors.\nValue 2: Facilitate Large-scale Blockchainization In A Fast And Cost-effective  Way. VeChain ToolChain \u2122 provides easy-to-use customizable tools. Food companies can build their exclusive business process easily as \"drag and drop\", which greatly saves the development investment, shortens the project lead time and achieves scalability.\nValue 3: Enhance Brand Image And Consumer Confidence On Food Products. The blockchain-enabled food safety solution powered by VeChain ToolChain \u2122 can improve communication and boost customer satisfaction. Retailers can choose to engage customers by providing access to related product and marketing information stored on the blockchain. This provides increased visibility into product origin, producer, quality, and the like, which in turn can build customer loyalty and contributes to a stronger business-customer relationship.\nValue 4: Unleash New Business Value By Data On Blockchain Platform The blockchain-enabled food safety solution powered by VeChain ToolChain \u2122 can help food companies exploit value via data generated by their own business. The immutable data on the blockchain enables companies to increase the efficiency of compliance review, government supervision, logistics and supplier evaluation and more . Companies will also gain access to world leading third-party services through the VeChain global partner network, including DNV GL, PwC and Deloitte, and more, greatly reducing the cost of certification, audit, insurance or supply chain financial services.\nAs the world's leading enterprise-friendly public blockchain company and platform, VeChain now has specialization in F&B traceability based on accumulated know-how and refined technology. Joining hands with its strategic partners, PwC and DNV GL, VeChain aims to expand the business globally to address business needs of more enterprises in the food industry.\nFor more information or business inquiries, please contact: bd@vechain.com \nAbout VeChain As a leading enterprise friendly public blockchain platform, VeChain began in 2015 and aims to connect blockchain technology to the real world by providing enterprises with blockchain solutions suitable for their business needs and to build a trust-free and distributed business ecosystem platform for business value.

And even then, neither house is planning to reconvene for final votes on bills until June \u2014 in large part because of the challenges for adequate physical distancing posed by the tightly placed desks for legislators in the chambers of the Senate and Assembly.\n\"I know it\u2019s going to be a very different way of doing business. But I think it was important for us to be here, to start thinking about the great challenges that we have ahead,\" Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) said during the day's first event, an Assembly hearing on healthcare issues.\nAccess to the historic statehouse remained limited. Those who were not legislators or staff members had their temperatures checked at the building's entrance. Elevators were limited to a single occupant \u2014 an easy rule to follow on Monday, given the Capitol's emptiness, but impossible during most springtime workdays, when dozens of hearings and events are usually scheduled.\n\"The work of the Legislature is essential for democracy, but preserving people's health as we do that is of the highest importance,\u201d Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) said in a statement. \u201cWe have spent the past six weeks developing a way to continue government with maximum safety.\"\nAssembly members were advised by Dr. Peter Beilenson, director of Sacramento's County Department of Health Services, to be screened for the novel coronavirus before returning Monday.\n\u201cTo protect both the legislators when they gather and the public who will be attending, I recommended that they get tested,\u201d he said in an interview.\nBecause asymptomatic people can still transmit the virus, Beilenson said, all lawmakers and staff should contact their private physicians to arrange coronavirus tests, even if they are not showing symptoms.\n\u201cAnyone testing positive should isolate themselves at home for 14 days,\u201d Beilenson wrote in a memo to the Assembly. \u201cOf course, any legislator or staff that falls in the high-risk groups (65-plus and/or chronic underlying health conditions) should follow the guidance of their healthcare provider in terms of their decision about whether or not they should attend the session.\u201d\nSome lawmakers, including Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), have balked at getting a test when many other members of the public, including healthcare workers, have not yet been checked for the virus. Gonzalez said she asked for a clear directive from Beilenson\u2019s office that she could give to her doctor, but she has not received one.\n\u201cAs such, I do not meet our county\u2019s criteria for testing and will not ask to be pushed to the front of the line,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIf I am required to get tested in Sacramento, exhibit any symptoms or am exposed to a COVID-19-positive individual, I will do so.\u201d\nAge is one risk factor among the 120 members of the Legislature. Thirteen members of the Senate are 65 or older, while 10 in that age group serve in the Assembly.\nCalifornia had more than 55,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,200 deaths tied to the virus as of Monday afternoon, according to data collected by The Times. A spokesman for Rendon said his office has not heard of any Assembly member testing positive for COVID-19.\nSix Assembly members asked for, and were granted, an excused absence from traveling to Sacramento due to age or underlying health conditions. One of them, Assemblyman Bill Quirk (D-Hayward), sent a letter to Rendon asking for consideration to vote remotely on bills.\n\u201cWe see individuals, despite taking the best of precautions, getting infected,\u201d Quirk said on Friday. \u201cThis is concerning.\"\nBut legislative lawyers think a 2016 constitutional amendment, approved by voters, makes that untenable. Article IV, Section 7 of the California Constitution says that \u201cthe proceedings of each house and the committees thereof shall be open and public,\u201d written as part of Proposition 54's mandate that bills be available for public review for 72 hours before a final vote. The concern is that lawmakers voting remotely won\u2019t meet the standard for public access to their actions.\nAssemblyman Kevin Mullin (D-San Mateo), who serves as speaker pro tem, says he\u2019s working on a constitutional amendment to help clarify the rules in hopes that it provides governing options in times like these and during natural disasters. The change would have to be approved by voters this November.\nHow much the Legislature can accomplish this year is limited by the calendar. Almost all of the Assembly\u2019s policy committees will meet only one more time this year to consider bills authored by its members. Only 14 bills were on the agenda for Monday's meeting of the Assembly Transportation Committee, even though legislative records show 84 bills were sent to the committee \u2014 meaning most of them will be held without further action.\nThe transportation panel offered one of the more unusual moments on Monday, its 15 members and assorted staff convening in the cavernous Assembly chamber, where they could safely spread out.\nTwo legislators wore gloves. One of them, Assemblyman Mike Gipson (D-Carson), sported a black protective mask with the phrase \"California Safe\" written in white letters.\n\"What a historic moment,\" said Assemblywoman Luz Rivas (D-North Hollywood) as she stood behind a stanchion to present her bill, Assembly Bill 3213, which seeks to force new project priorities for the California High-Speed Rail Authority. With no public witnesses in person or dialed in by phone, her bill was quickly approved and sent to the Assembly Appropriations Committee."}, {"RECORDID": "20200503-1856", "label": 1, "title": "Combating COVID-19: India gets 7 metric tonnes of medical supplies from UAE", "body": "Abu Dhabi [UAE], May 2: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Saturday sent a plane carrying seven metric tonnes of medical supplies to India to bolster the country's efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. \"The UAE is committed to extending critical support to nations seeking to bolster their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

How do this card\u2019s benefits stack up against other premium credit cards in the same price range? We\u2019re going to review the premium perks of the Mastercard Black Card and determine if there are better choices for your wallet.\nRelated reading: Battle of the premium travel rewards cards: Which is the best?\nThe Mastercard Black Card is one of three products offered by Luxury Card . It\u2019s designed with a unique black-PVD-coated stainless steel front and carbon back. Because of its alluring name, the Black Card gets the most attention.\nLet\u2019s start with the first thing most people look at when applying for a new card: the welcome bonus. The Black Card doesn\u2019t offer any sort of sign-up bonus, which immediately puts it at a disadvantage compared to other cards in the same annual fee range.\nThe Black Card earns a flat 1 point per dollar on all purchases, with no bonus categories to boost your return. You have two main redemption options: cash back or airfare. You can redeem your points for 2 cents each towards airfare, putting it well ahead of the competition. However, you can get significantly higher returns by transferring points from Chase, Citi or Amex to airline partners as opposed to redeeming them directly through the portal.\nWhen it comes to the Black Card\u2019s 1.5% cash back rate, non-premium cards like the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae or the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card also offer at least 1.5% cash back on all spending (Citi Double Cash offers up to 2% cash back; 1% when you buy, plus 1% as you pay). For a limited time, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card even allows you to redeem points at a 1.5 cents each towards select purchases.\nOf course earning and burning are only a part of the premium credit card equation, with many people choosing to pay hefty annual fees in order to unlock luxury travel perks. The Black Card offers an up to $100 annual airline credit (which can be used on airfare), a Priority Pass Select membership , an up to $100 Global Entry / TSA PreCheck application fee credit every five years and access to a VIP concierge 24/7. These perks are fairly standard on just about every premium credit card on the market.\nRelated reading: The best Mastercard credit cards of 2020\nThe Black Card comes with all the travel and purchase protections you expect to come with a premium product.

If the Black Card doesn\u2019t fit your needs, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a card to boost your earning rate and help you rack up points faster, the Chase Sapphire Reserve is a great choice, earning 3x on travel and dining. It charges a higher annual fee of $550, but it also offers a $300 annual travel credit that knocks your out-of-pocket cost well below that of the Black Card. Chase Ultimate Rewards also wins on the redemption side , allowing you to book travel through the Chase portal with a 50% bonus or transfer points to Chase\u2019s airline and hotel transfer partners to unlock some incredibly high value rewards.\nChase recently added limited-time, coronavirus-based benefits , including 5x on Instacart delivery and pickup orders on up to $3,000, up to $50 in statement credits towards an Instacart Express membership (annual or monthly), 5x at gas stations on up to $1,500 and 10x on select streaming services on up to $1,500. These benefits end on Sept. 30, 2020.\nExisting limited-time perks include: Pay Yourself Back, with each point worth 1.5 cents towards a statement credit used to offset purchases at grocery stores, home improvement stores and dining establishments through Sept. 30; expansion of the card\u2019s $300 annual travel credit, with the remaining balance automatically applied to purchases at grocery stores and gas stations through the end of the year; and the renewal annual fee lowered to $450 after July 1 through the end of 2020, replacing the previous $100 statement credit .\nIf you\u2019re primarily looking for luxury benefits, The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express may be a better choice. With its $550 annual fee(see rates and fees), the Platinum card comes with the most comprehensive airport lounge access around, including a Priority Pass membership , access to Amex Centurion lounges and access to Delta Sky Clubs when flying Delta. It also offers complimentary Gold elite status with both Marriott and Hilton and a host of other perks.\nThe annual fee is partially offset by an up to $200 annual airline incidental fee credit , a monthly $15 Uber credit ($20 in December) and an up to $100 annual Saks Fifth Avenue credit , broken up into $50 from January to June and another $50 from July to December.\nThe Amex Platinum is also among the cards to receive a host of temporary benefits , including up to $320 in statement credits on select streaming and wireless telephone services purchased directly from U.S. service providers (up to $20 per month) from May through December 2020.\nThe Mastercard Black Card has a lower annual fee than its top competitors, but the redemption options are somewhat limited. While cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve and Amex Platinum allow you to transfer rewards to various airline partners, the MasterCard Black Card limits redemptions to 2% on airfare and 1.5% on everything else. This makes the card less competitive in today\u2019s premium card landscape given its high annual fee, limited benefits and lack of bonus categories.\nFor rates and fees of the Platinum Card, please click here .\nAdditional reporting by Ben\u00e9t J.

Sanders wanted to mostly outlaw private health insurance in favor of enrolling everyone living in the US into a single government plan that would offer more benefits than Medicare does currently.\nThe battle over how far to extend the government's role in paying for healthcare became one of the leading feuds in the Democratic primary, and \"Medicare for all\" gained the support of former presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand.\nBiden said in a post on Medium that he was calling for lowering the age that people can sign up for Medicare as a direct response to the coronavirus pandemic. Expanding eligibility, he said, would \"help people find more secure footing in the long term once we have emerged from this crisis.\"\n\"It reflects the reality that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs,\" Biden said in his announcement.\nThe highest proportion of people who are uninsured in the US are between the ages of 19 and 34 , but older Americans who don't qualify for Medicare yet have had the hardest time finding affordable health insurance because they can be charged three times more than younger beneficiaries. At the same time, the inclusion of older beneficiaries in the markets also make costs rise for younger beneficiaries, who tend to have fewer healthcare needs.\nBiden provided few specifics Thursday other than to say he was directing his team to develop a plan to lower the age of Medicare eligibility. Currently, people are allowed to enroll in the program once they turn 65. Some people with severe health needs, including people on dialysis or people with Lou Gehrig's disease, can also qualify.\nThe latest idea adds to Biden's former proposal, which he frequently billed as a \"build on\" Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. As he fought for his party's nomination, he frequently accused Democratic rivals of wanting to \" get rid of Obamacare \" by pushing \"Medicare for all.\"\nThe government plan he pushed for instead, often called a \"public option\" would be available to people as an alternative to private health insurance, rather than having the government become the sole payer for healthcare services.\nBiden's plan would let people stay on private insurance they get through work if they choose, or be on Obamacare or the public option.\nThe portion that would pay for people to enroll in Medicare at age 60 would be financed out of general government revenues rather than the Medicare Trust Fund. That specification is presumably to address criticisms about Medicare's solvency. According to the Social Security and Medicare Trustees report, the part of Medicare that pays for inpatient hospital and hospice care will run out of full funding in 2026. Unless Congress fixes the financing, the program would pay a diminishing amount of reimbursement for medical costs.\nRead the original article on Business Insider"}, {"RECORDID": "20200522-88272", "label": -1, "title": "U.S. shale bust slams rural economies as oil checks shrivel | Reuters", "body": "By Jennifer Hiller\n7 Min Read\nDeWITT COUNTY, Texas (Reuters) - Royalties from oil pumped on Paul Ruckman\u2019s land allowed the South Texas retiree to build a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom vacation home. He had plenty left over, and donated some of it to Helena, Texas, an 1800s ghost town that draws hundreds to historic buildings and gunfight re-enactments.\nThe worst oil bust in decades has slashed the bounty that flowed to millions of rural Americans like Ruckman, who said his royalty checks have plummeted 70% since January.\n\u201cI imagine they\u2019re going to be dropping quite a bit more,\u201d said Ruckman, who owns the land with his brothers.\nThe bust has erased tens of thousands of jobs in the drilling and service sectors, dried up local tax revenues and charitable largess that flowed along with crude oil to Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma.\nThanks to modern drilling technology, shale has turned the United States into the world\u2019s No. 1 energy producer, pumping as much as 13 million barrels per day (bpd) before prices crashed. It added about a percentage point to U.S. GDP between 2010 and 2015.

OPEC and allied producers supported prices by cutting output, but this year Saudi Arabia and Russia briefly pumped more. Then fuel demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The payments have dwindled to $6,000 and by August, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be lucky to get anything.\u201d\nThe average oil-land owner collects about $500 a month, according to the National Association of Royalty Owners, but that will not last. April's price crash was so sharp, falling at one point into negative territory, that minerals holder Jubilee Royalty Holdings received a $1 check that month from Exxon Mobil XOM.N .\nThe shale boom paid off debt from restoring DeWitt\u2019s pink granite and sandstone courthouse and expanding the jail. Oil helped finance the area\u2019s Boys and Girls Club, which provides activities for area children.\nIt brought jobs that cut DeWitt\u2019s unemployment rate to 2.6% in February from 8% a decade earlier. During that time, oil and gas jobs here roughly doubled, according to the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association.\n(For a graphic on employment in shale regions, click here: tmsnrt.rs/3g9ppn1 )\nEMPTY \u2018MAN CAMP\u2019\nThe boom enabled bookkeeper Karen Jensen Zielonka to find work managing a new restaurant in 2015 and later gave her accounting work for Cuero Oilfield Lodging, a nearby \u201cman camp\u201d for transient workers.\n\u201cWhen this first happened they said it would last 25 years,\u201d said Zielonka.\nBut unemployment rose to 3.5% in March.

The value of DeWitt\u2019s mineral properties could fall this year by half, from $5.3 billion last year, county chief executive Daryl Fowler estimated.\nOfficials do not expect to reduce county jobs, \u201cbut it can happen,\u201d said Fowler.\nIn the last oil bust, from 2015-2016, DeWitt\u2019s average incomes fell 31%. That drop was short-lived, with pay rising again by 2018.\nOilfield worker Freddie Fuentes sailed through that period, without losing his job. He fears this one will sting much more.\n\u201cRight now we have about five weeks of work,\u201d said Fuentes. \u201cAfter that we\u2019re done.\u201d\nSome drillers hope for a turnaround. Oil prices have bounced from the April bottom when U.S. crude ended one day in negative territory. Prices now are about half January\u2019s level.\nLonestar Resources is putting oil in storage tanks that typically hold brackish water, said Chief Executive Frank Bracken, counting on a price rebound.\nStill, Bracken said, \u201croyalty owners are going to see vastly diminished paychecks.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s crash might be much worse than recent downturns, said Amanda Weinstein, assistant professor of economics at the University of Akron, who has studied shale booms. Young people who lose jobs may \u201cfeel like there\u2019s not as much for them in that town anymore,\u201d and leave.\nWilliston, North Dakota, center of the Bakken shale field, was so devastated by the 1980s bust that it lagged the nation in economic growth until shale started there around 2006, Weinstein said.\nAt the Helena ghost town, oil royalties donated by Ruckman and others fixed a historic home whose porch had been propped up with a salvaged telephone pole. The historical society had hoped to spruce up the attraction with a visitor\u2019s pavilion and new restrooms, said Trip Ruckman, Paul Ruckman\u2019s cousin.\n\u201cSome plans are on hold given the situation,\u201d he said.\n(For a graphic on the drop in drilling in DeWitt, click here: tmsnrt.rs/3bRgKSW )\nReporting by Jennifer Hiller in Texas, additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar; editing by Gary McWilliams and David Gregorio\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200727-50069", "label": -1, "title": "Ryanair nosedives into first-quarter loss on coronavirus", "body": "Irish no-frills airline Ryanair nosedived into the red in its first quarter, as the coronavirus pandemic decimated air travel demand and grounded fleets worldwide, the group said Monday.\nDublin-based Ryanair suffered a loss after taxation of 185 million euros ($216 million) in the three months to the end of June, or first quarter of its financial year, it revealed in a results statement.\nThe dire performance compared with net profit of 243 million euros in the same part of 2019 -- but nevertheless beat its own forecast for a loss of 200 million euros.\nPassenger numbers tumbled 99 percent to just 0.5 million people in the first quarter compared with 42 million a year earlier, while more than 99 percent of the airline's fleet remained on the tarmac.

In all, 15 new cases were recorded in mainland China on Wednesday, down from 24 the day before. Seven of the new cases were outside Hubei, including six imported from abroad.\nWhile only 85 of the cases in China have come from abroad, the rising number of such incidences has prompted authorities to shift their focus on containing the risk of imported cases.\nThe total number of cases recorded in mainland China was 80,793. As of Tuesday, 62,793 people had recovered and been discharged from hospital, or nearly 80% of the infections.\nIn Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, 34,094 patients had been discharged from hospitals, but over half were still under observation at so-called \u201crecovery stops\u201d - quarantine venues repurposed from hotels and student dormitories.\nHubei\u2019s health authority said the post-discharge quarantine was a precautionary measure, after a few discharged patients tested positive again.\nAs of the end of Wednesday, the death toll in mainland China had reached 3,169, up by 11 from the previous day. Hubei accounted for 10 of the new deaths, including seven in Wuhan.\nChina is focusing on restarting factories and businesses hit by the containment policies. Factory activity plunged to its worst level on record in February, and while more businesses have reopened in recent weeks as containment measures have been eased, analysts do not expect activity to return to normal until April.\nAirlines have been hit particularly hard.

The proposed $3 trillion Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions, or HEROES, Act would authorize another round of stimulus payments for most U.S. households. While the bill was passed by the Democrat-controlled House last month, it still must get through the Republican-controlled Senate.\nYet there are signs the White House may get behind additional stimulus funding, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that the administration is working on its own plan.

But here's what Americans could be looking at if the bill passes.\nThe HEROES Act offers a larger stimulus payment than the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. Under the new legislation each member of a household would receive $1,200, including children. The income thresholds would remain the same, meaning that single taxpayers earning less than $75,000 and married taxpayers earning a total of $150,000 would receive the full payments. For instance, a family of four whose parents earn less than $150,000 would receive $4,800.\nHEROES would cap total payments at $6,000 per family. Under CARES, a family of four whose parents earn less than a combined $150,000 received $3,400, since that law directed $500 for each child under the age of 17.\nTo see how much you would receive under the HEROES Act, you can check this stimulus calculator from OmniCalculator.\nOne criticism of the CARES Act stimulus payments is their restrictions on older teens and college students. Only dependents under 17 years old were eligible for the $500 payments, which excluded many high school juniors and seniors. The payments also excluded college students who were claimed as dependents on their parents' taxes.\nHEROES broadens its scope to include all dependents, which means that older teens and college students would be eligible for the $1,200 per-person payments.\nCARES also drew fire for its exclusion of many immigrants, including those who are in the U.S. legally. Only immigrants with Green Cards were allowed to receive stimulus money, which excludes millions of immigrants who pay taxes but haven't qualified for a Green Card. The law also excluded Americans who are married to immigrants without Green Cards, an exclusion that sparked lawsuits alleging discrimination against them as well as their American children denied payments.\nHEROES would require only that a taxpayer have a \"taxpayer identification number\" \u2014 a number used by immigrants to pay taxes \u2014 rather than a Social Security number, as CARES required.\nSome say Americans need even more help, while others believe it's best to wait to see if the economy picks up as businesses begin to reopen and rehire. Among those advocating for bigger payments is Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who with Democratic Senators Kamala Harris of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts have introduced a bill to provide $2,000 per month for every U.S. resident until the coronavirus crisis ebbs.\nIn the meantime, it's clear that most households across the country have taken an economic hit from the pandemic.

Chilean officials in April replaced a strict quarantine of several wealthy neighborhoods of Santiago with a string of constantly shifting closures in neighborhoods throughout the city.\n\u201cFor a short while we had a window of opportunity,\"' said Pablo Villalobos, a public health researcher at Harvard and adviser to the World Health Organization. \u201cIt was a lost opportunity.''\nThe virus started spreading virtually uncontrolled through Santiago at the start of May, helped by officials' refusal to shut down public transport.\nAnd controls supposedly in place weren't followed. Economy Minister Lucas Palacios said last month that 174,00 of the city's 427,000 businesses were still functioning, meaning 2.3 million people were working daily, despite a rule that was supposed to shut all but essential operations.\n\u201cThe government did not take the necessary restrictive measures,\" said Claudio Castillo, a public health expert at the University of Chile.\nCastillo said the government issued confusing public messages which led many Chileans to believe that only older people with preexisting conditions would be badly affected by the disease and that hospitals had sufficient capacity to treat people.\nPresident Sebastian Pi\u00f1era's government began talking in April about a safe return to relatively normal daily life.\nChile finally imposed a total lockdown in mid-May when cases started jumping by thousands daily. But the effect has been minimal, and the number of cases has multiplied sixfold since then.\nA study by the University of Development in Santiago found that movement around the city had diminished 29%, but needed to be down 50% to 60% in order to reduce the rate of infection significantly.\n\u201cThe government bet on a strategy,\" Villalobos said. \u201cIt didn't work.\""}, {"RECORDID": "20200423-38562", "label": 1, "title": "Casino's first quarter sales growth accelerates, boosted by food demand in France | Reuters", "body": "By Dominique Vidalon\n3 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - Retailer Casino CASP.PA , battling investor concerns over its high debt, said revenue growth accelerated in the first quarter, reflecting strong food sales in its core French market amid the coronavirus epidemic, and a robust performance in Brazil.\nCasino, which last month suspended its financial guidance for 2020 due to uncertainties tied to the coronavirus pandemic, said the lockdown in place in France since March 17 led to \u201cunprecedented\u201d food demand, notably at its convenience stores and in e-commerce.\nFinance Chief David Lubek told analysts he expected the trend to continue even as France exits lockdown from May 11.\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely demand for food retail will remain at high levels,\u201d he said.\nCasino, which has been selling assets to reduce its debt and which also controls Brazil's Grupo Pao de Acucar PCAR4.SA , posted first-quarter sales of 8.294 billion euros ($8.97 billion).\nOn a same-store basis and excluding acquisitions, currency effects and revenue on fuel, sales rose by 6.4% compared to 1.6%growth in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nIn France, total sales for the quarter came to 3.885 billion euros, an increase of 5.8% on a same-store basis.\nCity centre convenience stores and E-commerce have been in particularly high demand since the lockdown started, with sales rising 3.6% at Monoprix and 12.6% at Franprix.\nMeanwhile Geant Hypermarkets sales grew by a more modest 1.5% on a same-store basis, of which 2.9% was in food.\nThe environment has been more challenging in France for large hypermarkets since the lockdown as shoppers have favoured small stores and online.\nGeant Casino hypermarkets have, however, developed a home delivery solution in around 41 cities and established a partnership with Uber Eats, the group said.\nCasino\u2019s e-commerce business recorded same-store growth of 43% for the quarter, and a threefold increase in activity over the last four weeks, particularly led by home delivery, Drive and click & collect.\nCasino CEO and controlling shareholder Jean-Charles Naouri has been hunting for ways to ease the company's debts - and those of parent company Rallye GENC.PA , which was placed under protection from creditors in May 2019 - through asset sales and refinancing efforts.\nIn March, Casino agreed to sell 567 Leader Price stores in France, plus three warehouses, to German discount rival Aldi in a deal with an enterprise value of 735 million euros.\nPreparatory work for the closing has been initiated and is ongoing, the group said.\nReporting by Dominique Vidalon; editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Philippa Fletcher\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200608-63129", "label": 1, "title": "CANADA FX DEBT-C$ notches 3-month high as investors bet on economic recovery", "body": "* Canadian dollar rises 0.3% against the greenback * Loonie touches its strongest since March 4 at 1.3369 * Canadian housing starts rise to 193,453 units in May * Canadian bond yields were mixed across a flatter curve TORONTO, June 8 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened to a three-month high against its U.S. counterpart on Monday as hopes of a quick economic rebound from the coronavirus crisis offset lower oil prices.

LME broker Marex Spectron estimates net speculative short positioning reached 32% of LME open interest on Tuesday, the largest collective bear bet since November 2015, when it peaked at 38% of open interest.\nMeanwhile, in China the market \u201cis running record shorts\u201d on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) zinc contract, Marex said.\nZinc\u2019s problem is that the coronavirus has darkened further an already bearish outlook.\nStocks of zinc registered with the ShFE have mushroomed from 28,054 tonnes at the end of December to 162,402 tonnes.\nInventory build over China\u2019s new year holiday period is normal. The scale of this year\u2019s build isn\u2019t normal. It already exceeds the peak seasonal increases of 104,000 tonnes in 2019 and 91,000 tonnes in 2018.\nQuarantine and restrictions on travel have worked to slow the post-holiday return to work, disrupting the zinc value chain in China.\nMoreover, zinc is particularly exposed to the economic impact of the virus via its use in galvanised steel in the automotive and construction sectors.\nChina\u2019s giant automotive market was already struggling before the coronavirus. Now it is collapsing.\nPassenger car retail sales in China fell 80% in February because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to the China Passenger Car Association.\nGlobalised automotive supply chains mean that this is not just a Chinese problem but could affect other countries\u2019 automotive output.\nCarmakers such as Honda and Hyundai are closing plants in Japan because of a lack of Chinese parts and components, said Alessandro Nicita, an economist at UNCTAD.\nThe United Nations agency estimates a shortage of Chinese components caused a $50 billion fall in global exports last month, with the automotive industry one of the most affected.\nProperty sales in China have also collapsed, which may affect the sector\u2019s ability to maintain construction and completion rates. That hits zinc due to its use in white household goods.\nSome mitigation to this demand shock has come from disruption to China\u2019s giant zinc production sector.\nHenan Yuguang Gold and Lead, one of China\u2019s biggest zinc and lead producers, has cut zinc output by 50%, or around 150,000 tonnes per year, because it has been unable to sell the sulphuric acid generated as a by-product of the smelting process.\nOthers have reduced operating rates or brought forward planned maintenance work to offset logjammed logistics affecting both their raw material and product chains.\nThe build in Shanghai stocks would probably be even more massive were it not for this supply-side offset.\nUnfortunately for the zinc price, China\u2019s producers are likely to return to normal operations before the downstream sector, meaning further increases in both visible exchange and off-market inventory in the country.\nThe big commodity banks have had it in for zinc for many months basis a storyline of a market transitioning from a period of chronic mine supply shortfall to one of surplus.\nThis process has already played out in the raw materials segment of the zinc supply chain, with smelters enjoying treatment charges of over $300 per tonne in a saturated zinc concentrates market.\nWhat the bears have been waiting for is tangible evidence that the raw materials surplus is travelling down the value chain to become metal surplus.\nWith non-Chinese smelter capacity constrained, all eyes were on Chinese producers to start lifting run-rates, which they did aggressively over the back end of 2019.\nInventory build in China was expected this year, but the coronavirus demand shock is now accelerating the process - witness the ballooning stocks on the Shanghai exchange.\nSo far, at least, the surplus is stuck in China behind the country\u2019s export tariffs.\nThe last chapter of zinc\u2019s bear story, the move to visible surplus outside of China, is still to play out.\nThere has been only a modest rise in stocks of zinc held by the LME.\nA flurry of deliveries onto LME warrant in February lifted headline stocks from 51,200 tonnes at the start of the year to the 75,000-tonne level.\nBut since then stocks have plateaued, even while available tonnage has edged lower due to a steady trickle of cancellations as metal is taken off-warrant prior to physical load-out.\nThese are still ultra-low exchange stock levels by any historical yardstick.\nBut the LME zinc spread structure has loosened dramatically over the last couple of weeks, the benchmark cash-to-three months spread flipping from a backwardation of over $20 in January to a contango of $19.50 per tonne as of Thursday\u2019s closing valuations.\nThe spread is signalling there is ample metal available, even if it is not evident from the exchange\u2019s own registered stock levels.\nAll the funds betting on lower zinc prices better hope this is a true signal rather than a hall-of-mirrors LME stocks reflection.\nThey have already paid the price several times for getting their bear timing wrong in the zinc market, with spreads flaring out as shorts rolled positions in the confines of limited LME stocks availability.\nThere are a lot of shorts in London. There is still very low stocks cover. The surplus is building in China, but until it becomes evident elsewhere, bears could yet be caught out again.\nT he opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.\nEditing by Jan Harvey\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200327-25328", "label": 0, "title": "Shareholders of Korean Air parent keep chairman on board after proxy battle | Reuters", "body": "By Joyce Lee\n3 Min Read\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Shareholders of Korean Air\u2019s parent firm Hanjin Kal voted on Friday to keep group chairman Walter Cho as a board director, an outcome seen by analysts as a victory for the status quo at the conglomerate.\nCho, 44, who became chairman after his father\u2019s death last year, fended off a challenge from his older sister and an activist fund to replace him with a professional manager.\nAbout 57% of Hanjin Kal shareholders represented at the annual general meeting (AGM) voted for him to continue as a director of the parent firm.\nBut the roughly 48% of shareholders voting for mobile industry veteran Kim Shin-bae, nominated by Cho\u2019s sister Heather and activist fund Korea Corporate Governance Improvement (KCGI), Hanjin Kal\u2019s biggest shareholder, to join the board, fell short of a majority.\nThe proxy fight has been a major distraction for the loss-making airline as it struggles to survive the severe aviation industry downturn triggered by a coronavirus pandemic.\nFrom April, all executives will forgo 30% to 50% of their salaries, the carrier said this week.\n\u201cSome shareholders may have made a conservative choice as the airline industry is directly hit by coronavirus,\u201d said Park Sang-in, a professor at Seoul National University.\nHowever, the fight is probably not over.\nBoth Delta Air, a Korean Air joint-venture partner seen as a \u201cwhite knight\u201d for Walter Cho, as well as opposing shareholders, including KCGI and builder Bando Engineering & Construction, have boosted stakes since the end of 2019.\n\u201cWhile (Walter) Cho stemmed a crisis this time around, questions about Hanjin\u2019s governance issues, and his uncertain position of relying on other shareholders like Delta, his mother and younger sister has not changed,\u201d Park said.\n\u201cHe will have to prove his capabilities by normalising Korean Air\u2019s management difficulties.\u201d\nDelta had a stake of 14.9% in Hanjin by this month, up from 10% in September, while KCGI had 18.6%, up from 17.1% late last year.

NiSource's core business strategy is expected to drive long-term revenue and dividend growth, supported by stable, rate base driven revenue streams and approximately $40 billion in expected infrastructure investment opportunities over 20 years. These investment opportunities represent an increase of $10 billion over prior expectations, driven by incremental investments in renewable generation and safety and asset modernization enhancements across both gas and electric operations which total $9.9 \u2013 $10.5 billion of capital investment opportunities during the 2021 \u2013 2024 plan period.\nAt Investor Day, NiSource will discuss its recently launched NiSource Next initiative, a comprehensive program designed to identify long-term, sustainable capability enhancements and cost efficiency improvements. Through this program, the company anticipates driving continuous operational learnings and improvements throughout the organization, while also contributing to an approximately 8% reduction in O&M costs in 2021 from expected 2020 levels. This cost reduction is expected to offset future inflationary pressure to keep O&M costs relatively flat through 2024 and ensure customers realize the value of the company's enhanced capabilities.\nExecution of NiSource's strategy is expected to drive a rate base compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% \u2013 12%, which is expected to result in a 7% \u2013 9% NOEPS CAGR, and annual dividend growth to maintain the company's targeted 60% \u2013 70% payout ratio over 2021 \u2013 2024. Through the execution of a strong rate base growth strategy while focusing on safety enhancing capital deployment, and executing NiSource Next, customer affordability is preserved throughout the planning horizon.\nGrowth Driven by Safety, Risk Mitigation and Customer Service\nNiSource continues to prioritize its safety initiatives across its gas and electric businesses, including its SMS implementation, which improves and drives robust operating standards, risk identification and mitigation capabilities. The company's $1.9 \u2013 $2.2 billion in planned annual capital investment in its growth, safety and asset modernization programs is enhancing NiSource's system safety and reliability while driving shareholder value. The company will also discuss how its NiSource Next program further supports the high priority NiSource places on safety, risk mitigation and customer service.\nRenewable Generation Transition Strategy Focused on Affordability and Sustainability\nNiSource continues to execute its renewable generation transition strategy that embraces the need for clean energy in supporting its customers and communities through its NIPSCO gas and electric distribution company in Indiana . The company is focused on retiring 100% of coal generation assets by 2028 and replacing them primarily with renewables.\nAs part of NIPSCO's planned replacement of approximately 1,400 megawatts of retiring coal-fired generation in 2023, NiSource has identified $1.8 \u2013 $2.0 billion in capital investment opportunities, incremental to our previous capital plan, to be deployed primarily across 2022 and 2023. These investments in renewable energy will provide benefits for customers and value for shareholders. The overall replacement plan is expected to save NIPSCO's electric customers more than $4 billion in costs over 30 years when compared to the continued operation of NIPSCO's current generation fleet and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 90 percent by 2030 compared to a 2005 baseline.\n\"Our approach across our portfolio is focused on driving affordability for our customers and sustainability for the communities we serve. It's important that we listen to our customers and pursue strategic investments that meet their evolving demands for more affordable, and cleaner energy resources,\" said Hamrock.\nToday's Investor Day Presentation\nNiSource's Investor Day presentation will be webcast with accompanying presentations on www.nisource.com starting at 11:00 am ET and is expected to conclude by 1:00 pm ET .

The company includes this measure because management believes it permits investors to view the company's performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the company's ongoing business performance. With respect to such guidance, it should be noted that there will likely be a difference between this measure and its GAAP equivalent due to various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in weather, the impact of asset sales and impairments, and other items included in GAAP results.

Steve Sisolak at a press conference Thursday night. More details about the other counties and the factors that went into closing establishments that don't serve food were released Friday afternoon.\nSisolak said the closures will help slow the spread of the coronavirus. The state made its decision based on three population-based criteria, which factored in the number of tests administered and how many come back positive.\nThe closures apply to all establishments that don't serve food, including bars in casinos.\nCoronavirus updates: 1,004 new cases in Nevada in past 24 hours; bars closing in Washoe\nCounties will be re-evaluated\u00a0no earlier than\u00a0two weeks from now and must show positive trends in at least\u00a0two of the three risk criteria\u00a0to be allowed to reopen.\u00a0The first\u00a0 re-evaluation will be on July 24.\nAlso under Sisolak's directive, restaurants can no longer serve parties larger than six people and must close their bar areas. He also encouraged restaurants to have people eat outside.\nHe said the decision came after a Thursday call with representatives from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who advised him that Nevada needed to take swift action to avoid overwhelming its hospital facilities with COVID-19 patients.\n\"We know that COVID-19 can easily spread when people are congregating for long periods of time, like inside a bar. In states where we have seen significant spikes, such as Arizona, Texas and Florida, they have all taken actions to roll back bars,\" Sisolak said on Thursday.\n\"Recently,\u00a0Dr. (Anthony) Fauci, the US's top infectious-disease expert,\u00a0advised that congregating in bars\u00a0poses\u00a0a significant risk\u00a0and is one of the most dangerous things people could do right now.

This number is then multiplied by 100,000\u00a0to control for varying populations in counties.\u00a0Counties with\u00a0a case rate higher than\u00a0100\u00a0will meet this elevated disease transmission risk criteria.\nOn Friday, the state detailed the\u00a0criteria each county fell short on, forcing the closure of its bars.

Other subjects that Khan mentioned in his speech included fiscal recovery from the impact of COVID-19, international money laundering and its impact on developing countries, climate change and Islamophobia.\nAfter he had addressed these issues, Khan spent the remainder of his time talking about Kashmir and India\u2019s abrogation of Article 370 last year. Here is a round-up of everything Khan mentioned with regard to Pakistan\u2019s ongoing diplomatic disputes with India.\nThe hint that Khan\u2019s speech would take this direction and focus on Pakistan\u2019s disputes with India came relatively early on when the leader touched upon his country\u2019s foriegn policy. \u201cA just and humane society where all government policies are directed at lifting our citizens out of poverty and creating a just and equitable dispensation. Thus our foreign policy aims to have peace with our neighbours and to settle disputes through dialogue,\u201d Khan had said.\nA few minutes later, Khan indicated that the UN was the only body that could help Pakistan achieve its goals in its neighbourhood. The leader then switched to indirectly referencing the abrogation of Article 370 by claiming that the \u201cself-determination of peoples, the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of states, non-interference in the internal affairs, international cooperation; all these ideals are being systematically eroded.\u201d Before moving on to focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic and how Pakistan has coped with infections, Khan said: \u201cInternational agreements are being set aside\u2026.military occupation, illegal annexations are suppressing the rights of human beings to self-determination.\u201d\nPM Narendra Modi in UNGA 2020 | Where is United Nations in Covid-19 fight\nWhat did Khan say about Islamophobia?\nKhan said the COVID-19 pandemic has \u201cfanned nationalism\u201d and \u201chas given rise to racial and religious hatred and violence\u201d against minorities and has accentuated \u201cIslamophobia\u201d. Khan pointed to French news publication Charlie Hebdo for republishing \u201cblasphemous sketches\u201d, and said wilful provocations and incitement to hate and violence\u201d must be \u201coutlawed\u201d.\nAlthough the leader said that Muslims were being \u201ctargeted with impunity\u201d in several countries and their shrines destroyed, he refrained from calling out China for its persecution of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.\nImran Khan singled out India in his UNGA speech by claiming that it was the only \u201cone country\u201d that \u201cstate sponsors Islamophobia\u201d, rooted in \u201cRSS ideology\u201d. Khan went on to discuss the origins of the RSS in significant detail, claiming that the organisation was \u201cinspired by the Nazis\u201d and their \u201cconcepts of racial purity and supremacy\u201d. \u201cWhile the Nazis hate was directed at the Jews, the RSS directs it towards the Muslims and to a lesser extent towards the Christians,\u201d Khan said.\nCiting the examples of the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the burning of the Samjhota Express train, the RSS, Khan said, believes that India is \u201cexclusive for Hindus and others are not equal citizens\u201d and had engaged in the \u201ccleansing\u201d of \u201c200 million Muslims and other minorities\u201d.\nKhan also mentioned the NRC and CAA, particularly its impact in Assam, where \u201ctwo million Muslims\u201d were facing being stripped of their citizenship. \u201cThere are reports of large concentration camps being filled with by Muslim Indian citizens,\u201d Khan said (sic).\n\ud83d\udce3 Express Explained is now on Telegram .

In what seems like a reference to the CAA and NRC, Khan called \u201cmass registrations\u201d a \u201cprecursor to genocide\u201d and equated it with Germany in 1935 during the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws and the implementation of Myanmar\u2019s citizenship laws in 1982. Khan added that \u201cHindutva ideology...does not augur well for the future of India\u201d.\nLast in its attacks against India was the issue of Kashmir, particularly the abrogation of Article 370. Khan accused India of \u201cupping the military ante\u201d against Pakistan to divert attention from Jammu and Kashmir. Khan claimed that Islamabad had \u201cexercised maximum restraint\u201d in circumstances where India had purportedly engaged in \u201cprovocations and ceasefire violations\u201d along the Line of Control and Working Boundary.\nKhan stated that Islamabad would fight for \u201cits freedom to the end\u201d if India\u2019s \u201cfascist totalitarian RSS-led government\u201d attempted to \u201caggress\u201d Pakistan. Khan ended his statements on Kashmir by saying that there would be no \u201cpeace and stability\u201d in South Asia till the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir was resolved \u201con the basis of international legitimacy\u201d.\nPointing to the United Nations Security Council resolution 1264 in 1999 where the international body intervened in East Timor for the people to vote for independence from Indonesia, Khan called for similar resolutions to be enacted in Jammu and Kashmir. \u201cIndia must rescind the measures it has instituted since 5 August 2019,\u201d Khan said.\n\nCoronavirus Explained\nClick here for more\nWhat else did Khan say?\nKhan closed his speech referring to the US-Taliban Peace Agreement in February 2020 and the potential path forward for Afghanistan and its impact on Pakistan due to their shared borders.

Additional sides of creamed corn, creamed spinach and garlic bread are also available.

We went longer than many, our outbreak is certainly not as significant as what we are seeing in Vietnam, in Hong Kong, in South Korea or in Australia,\" she told state broadcaster TVNZ."}, {"RECORDID": "20200719-23353", "label": -1, "title": "EssilorLuxottica Takes Acquisition Target to Court", "body": "Click here to read the full article.\nPARIS \u2014 The eyewear wars are not over.

Behind the initial optimism was the return to business in China, where production was fully operational with spare capacity in March. To deal with the crisis, EssilorLuxottica has adjusted production according to demand, implemented cost and cash control measures, and suspended lower priority investments.

That could mean better data now provides little guidance about the path ahead.\nRising coronavirus case numbers around the globe are also likely to weigh on consumer and business confidence, holding back spending and investment and raising the chance that any recovery would be slow, uneven and prone to interruptions.\nWith exports, industrial production and confidence indicators still muted, economists say the ECB\u2019s pause is only temporary and that more action could come this autumn.\nLagarde said that despite evidence of a \u201cbottoming out\u201d in April, there remained high uncertainty about the ability of authorities to contain the spread of the virus and to counter the impact on incomes, employment and consumer demand.\nPEPP purchases are due to continue until at least June 2021, with proceeds from those purchases to be reinvested until the end of 2022, she said.\n($1 = 0.8750 euros)\nEditing by Catherine Evans\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200725-4063", "label": -1, "title": "Triple-headers can't be new standard for F1 calendars, warns McLaren's Seidl", "body": "McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl has warned that triple-headers must not become the new standard for Formula 1's future calendars despite their frequency through 2020.\nF1 is set to begin its second triple-header of the season next weekend at Silverstone after running races on three consecutive weekends in Austria and Hungary earlier this month.\nA third triple-header is scheduled at the end of the summer as part of the push to bolster the calendar after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of much of the planned races this year.\nF1 trialed its first triple-header back in 2018, only for the teams to urge that it could not be repeated in the future due to the stresses it placed on staff members.\nMcLaren F1 team principal Seidl said that while the triple-headers were necessary in 2020 to boost the calendar and help increase the sport's revenues, it could not be seen as a new standard for future seasons.\n\"We're going now into the triple-header with these two races in the UK, which is obviously for the UK teams is not as bad as for some other teams,\" Seidl said.\n\"At least we have the possibility to arrive at the track as late as possible with only a short travel, and having a break between these two Silverstone races.\n\"Then we go into another triple-header, and then at the moment I think on the schedule there is another triple-header later on, which I think then is tough.\n\"Given the special circumstances we are in this year, it's something we simply have to get through this year.\n\"But at the same time, this cannot be the new standard going forward also in future seasons.\"\nTeams are currently trying to keep its staff fresh during a run of nine races in 11 weeks, with some opting to rotate roles where possible over the triple-headers.\nFor Seidl, the biggest challenge facing the teams was the sheer amount of time they had to spend on the road through this season, getting fewer opportunities to return home between races due to the strict biosphere protocols.\n\"I don't think that the biggest challenge is actually the work we have to do out here at the track,\" Seidl said.\n\"It's also tough work, but I think the biggest issue is being away from the families and the kids and so on, for each team member.\n\"Going through this first triple-header after this long break we had, I think it's also not the biggest challenge yet.\n\"We need to be aware that the longer we go now in the season, especially the triple-headers that are coming later on, that will be a big challenge for the team.\n\"What we do from a team side is try to make travelling, accommodation, and everything we can provide to the team here at the track and back at the hotels as comfortable as possible and as good as possible, simply to get through as a team in the best possible shape.\n\"At the same time, I think everyone inside the team understands that this is a special season, under special circumstances after this virus broke out.\n\"We all understand also that it's absolutely necessary for the existence of the teams that we do these races this year.\n\"I simply hope that with everything we do together with the team, having an open ear also, listening to where the problems are within the team or each team member, and we hopefully manage to get through in a sustainable way.\"\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus"}, {"RECORDID": "20200503-6369", "label": 0, "title": "MMR Vaccine Likely Why COVID-19 Rarely Hitting Young According to World Organization", "body": "The common MMR vaccine could be critical to protecting patients over 50 and other vulnerable populations from COVID-19 according to Dr. Larry P.

The rest from the United States, Canada and others, will come as a result of weak pricing and happen over time.\n\u201cWith demand destruction forecasts ranging from 15 million to 22 million bpd in April 2020 and these measures not even coming into place until May, we are likely to see a substantial overhang in the short-term,\u201d said Nitesh Shah, director of research at New York-based WisdomTree Investments.\nAs a result, physical markets where crude is traded, such as in Houston or London, suggest prices will not recover for a while as storage fills.\nU.S. crude inventories rose 13.1 million barrels in the week to April 10 to 486.9 million barrels, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday.

(\" Willow \" or the \" Company \") (TSX: WLLW) (OTCQB: CANSF) is pleased to announce that it has further accelerated its path to commercialization following continued scale-up development success and the addition of multiple new cannabinoids for production. Willow is a Canadian biotechnology company creating high purity, plant-derived compounds for the global pharmaceutical, health and wellness and consumer packaged goods industries.\n\"Willow's scientific and operational success to date has solidified the use of yeast fermentation as a production platform,\" said Trevor Peters , Willow's Chief Executive Officer. \"Our scientific discoveries over the past 14 months have contributed to the development of not one, but five different cannabinoids and our pilot project production samples expected to be available in Q3 of 2020 will make Willow the first to biosynthetically produce material amounts of cannabinoids. We expect to offer a portfolio of ultra-pure, pharmaceutical grade quality cannabinoids by the end of 2021. As we transition from a research-focused company to a production company, we are investigating a variety of end markets, including pharmaceutical and consumer products. We see significant potential in consumer packaged goods for the North American recreation market, where interest for high quality ingredients such as ours is strong.\"\nAccelerated Pilot Scale Production\nThe Company announced it has commenced scale-up in March of this year with its development partner, Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (\" AMRI \"). During this time, Willow has made significant improvements to both its proprietary cannabinoid-producing yeast strains and production process at 20 liter scale. Having reached its development milestones with AMRI ahead of schedule, and due to interest received from consumer packaged goods companies in the North American recreational market, Willow has expedited its 500 liter pilot from Q4 2020 to early Q3 2020, and expects to be in a position to deliver samples of cannabigerol (\" CBG \") and cannabidiol (\" CBD \") in Q3 and Q4, respectively. This success puts the Company's pilot six months ahead of schedule, largely driven by the innovation, commitment and expertise of its industry-leading science team.\nCannabigerol\nIn addition to progressing its work in developing CBD producing yeast strains, the Company has developed a process to produce CBG, which is a promising cannabinoid with early research suggesting it has anti-microbial and antioxidant properties. While CBG cannot be produced in appreciable quanitities in the plant, Willow's proprietary yeast production process is expected to be able to produce commercial quantities. Willow anticipates being able to commercialize CBG in the first half of 2021 and the Company is in the process of selecting its manufacturing locations, from which it can reach both local and world markets. While the market for CBG is still developing, the Company believes there is substantial nascent demand for the product, which cannot be met by plant extracts alone. Willow sees significant potential in CBG for people seeking the therapeutic effects of the cannabis plant.\nVarin Cannabinoids\nThe success of the Company's proprietary yeast producton platform has enabled Willow to develop strains for producing additional high value cannabinoids. The Company has developed yeast strains and methodologies that allow it to produce significant quantities of cannabigerovarin (\" CBGV \") at lab scale. Based on the accelerated pace of Willow's CBG and CBD programs and the initial success with CBGV, the Company has allocated resources to the development of commercial processes for CBGV, cannabidivarin (\" CBDV \") and tetrahydrocannabivarin (\" THCV \"), all three of which are collectively referred to as the \"Varin cannabinoids\". The Varin cannabinoids are considered minor or rare cannabinoids in that they occur naturally in cannabis plants at less than one percent of biomass, making them challenging and costly to produce via cultivation. Despite the lack of supply, there are advanced clinical trials and significant recreational interest due to the possible therapeutic benefits of the unique properties of the Varin cannabinoids. Willow expects to be in a position to start commercialization of the Varin cannabinoids in the second half of 2021.\nGrowing Intellectual Property Portfolio\nWillow continues to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio and aggressively protect proprietary rights on significant discoveries. Since the beginning of 2020, the Company has filed multiple patent applications covering a diverse collection of more than 200 novel genes that help to increase cannabinoid production and purity in yeast. The majority of the discovered genes originate from our proprietary genomic databases that are expected to lead to multiple additional discoveries and patents throughout 2020 and beyond.\nAbout Willow Biosciences Inc.\nWillow is a Canadian biotechnology company based in Calgary, Alberta , that produces high purity, plant-derived compounds that provide building blocks for the global pharmaceutical, health and wellness, and consumer packaged goods industries. Willow's current focus is in the production of cannabinoids for the treatment for pain, anxiety, obesity, brain disorders, among other significant indications. Willow's science team has a proven track record of developing manufacturing technologies for high purity compounds in pain and cancer treatments. Willow's manufacturing process creates a consistent, scalable and sustainable product that allows for the discovery and development of new life changing drugs.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may include forward-looking statements including opinions, assumptions, estimates and the Company's assessment of future plans and operations, and, more particularly, statements concerning: Willow's revised milestone projections, including the timing of pilot projects, the delivery of sample cannabinoids and commercialization scale-up; discussions with consumer-packaged goods companies and manufacturing partners; expected therapeutic benefits from cannabinoids; expected patent filings; expected demand for cannabinoids; the market size potential of the synthetic cannabinoid industry; Willow's entry into new global markets; and the business plan of the Company, generally, including cannabinoid research and production.

But tech businesses also know the South East Asian nation as a place of innovation and consumer experimentation.\nThe challenges are well-known: the country is Muslim-majority, but also multi-ethnic; Indonesia\u2019s tropical archipelago geography is a stretch for any corporation; and only a sliver of its 250 million population have yet got into the habit of recurring subscription payments for dematerialized goods and services.\nInnovation and scale come together this weekend, when Indonesia is the venue of what is arguably Disney\u2019s most ambitious rollout of its Disney Plus direct-to-consumer streaming service. Being launched as Disney Plus Hotstar , a reference to the Hotstar platform that Disney acquired as part of Twentieth Century Fox, the new platform is a partnership with local phones giant Telkomsel . And it has by far the most local content of any Disney Plus territory, bar India.\nBoth companies describe the launch as transformational. Speaking at the APOS convention this week Setyanto Hantoro, President Director of Telkomsel explained how video entertainment is key the mutation of his company from unglamorous phones giant into a digital company, and specifically \u201cthe home of entertainment in Indonesia.\u201d\n\u201cThe launch of Disney Plus Hotstar in Indonesia, and also our collaboration with them, is transformational because it will expand digital service choice and also deepen digital lifestyle habits for all people in Indonesia,\u201d Hantoro told Variety on the sidelines of the conference.\nHe adds, \u201cIt came just at the right moment, because SVOD has become one of the most preferred platforms in Indonesia, especially during the pandemic. Our customers, are eager to enjoy easy access to entertainment while also having quality time with their family or even with themselves.\u201d\nUday Shankar, president of The Walt Disney Company in APAC, says that using Indian software engineering and the Hotstar name as part of the local branding made sense in Indonesia. As in India, Hollywood content alone might not have been enough of a value proposition to win over the Indonesian public.\n\u201cWe have kept the Indonesian consumer in mind while designing the offering, be that the content, the product, or the pricing,\u201d Shankar told Variety . \u201cDisney Plus Hotstar includes the best of global and local content on a single app.\u201d\nAt launch, the service will offer 13 exclusive premieres of Indonesian movies from local studios MD Pictures and Falcon. These include \u201cSejuta Sayang Untuknya,\u201d \u201cWarkop DKI Reborn 4\u201d and \u201cDenting Kematian,\u201d and is a total up from seven when the service was teased in August . It also sets off with a library of over 300 Indonesian movies, including several previous box office winners.\nIn a market where most consumers do not have a credit card, and are deeply price conscious, the partnership structure makes sense, especially if it can also provide Disney with billing and marketing relations it would otherwise have to build for itself.\n\u201cTapping into Telkomsel\u2019s advanced broadband network and their customer services, such as marketing efforts and billing system, together with their attractive and affordable pricing packages, will enable subscribers to have easy access to our high-quality entertainment content,\u201d says Shankar.\nAlso compelling is the ability of the partnership to offer wary consumers a package that combines data and content, and to create bargain offers. Normal monthly subscription is set at Rp 39,000 per month or Rp 199,000 annually \u2014 just $2.64 and $13.5 respectively. In the first two months, the introductory offer is just Rp20,000 ($1.4) and comes bundled with dozens of a gigabytes of data. (A pre-launch offer included monthly access at RP15,000 and 39GB of data.) Packages are available via one, three, six and 12-month subscription plans, Hantoro explains. The platform is accessible via the website, Android and iOS smartphones, Android TV and Fire TV Stick.\n\u201cWe want to give our customers a sense of comfort in enjoying world-class content without worries on data usage. We want to ensure Indonesian users [develop] sustainable behavior, and enjoy Disney Plus Hotstar in the long-term,\u201d Hantoro said.\nThe launch comes at an interesting moment. Even before the coronavirus gave OTT a boost, streaming services were beginning to take off in Indonesia in a fashion that had eluded more conventional pay-TV models. The country recently stood up to western tech firms and introduced a requirement that streamers collect value added tax in the same way that local broadcasters do. And Telkomsel unblocked Netflix, which in its early days was seen as an upstart foreign invader.\nThe recent demise of two regional streaming rivals, Hooq and Iflix (acquired by China\u2019s Tencent) may give Disney Plus Hotstar an opportune moment to launch. But a host of nimble local and regional platforms will be ready to step in should the heavyweights misstep."}, {"RECORDID": "20200728-58718", "label": 1, "title": "New Non-Profit Study Finds That 90% of California Adults Say They Are Complying with Mask Wearing & Social Distancing Directives", "body": "PR Newswire\nLOS GATOS, Calif., July 27, 2020\nLOS GATOS, Calif. , July 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Healthcare Consumer Rights Foundation (HCRF), a healthcare consumer-focused non-profit, released a new and compelling study measuring the compliance of Californians to COVID-19 safety measures. The COVID-19 Compliance Scale results below are the first in an ongoing study and is intended to be a resource to inform policymakers and the public alike on the public's attitudes that should be considered when measuring approaches to fighting the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 Compliance Scale survey interviewed 800 California adults between July 9 and July 15 and measures 13 indicators of Californians' compliance with various COVID-19 health and safety recommendations. Each indicator, asked as a question, was scaled as Almost Never, Seldom, Sometimes, Often, and Almost Always .\nResults and methodology of the study can be viewed here .\nReporting on the results, healthcare consumer advocate and HCRF Executive Director Steve Poizner noted, \"The COVID-19 Compliance Scale shows that the overwhelming number of respondents consider themselves compliant and claim to Almost Always wear a mask, practice social distancing, avoid shaking hands, and wash their hands. Based on this study, Californians believe that they are taking the prescribed actions to slow or stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\"\nSJR Opinion Research, directed by Dr. Val Smith , Ph.D., conducted the new study for HCRF. They used factor analysis methodology to reveal underlying groups of indicators and identify a relationship between similar factors. The factor analysis reduced the 13 indicators to a smaller set of variables that reflect the way the public conceptualizes the problem. The study labels these three concepts: (1) Defensive Behaviors, (2) Mobility, and (3) Government Credibility.\n\"Roughly 90% of the adult population claim to practice defensive behaviors, like wearing a mask. They Usually or Almost Always adhere to these mandates and recommendations.\n\"Compliance drops to about 75% for the mobility indicators. Roughly one out of four respondents said they Almost Never , Seldom , or only Sometimes comply with desired mobility behaviors. The exception was the behavior of visit public outdoor spaces (e.g., parks, trails, beaches). This indicator was upside down, achieving only 46% compliance. All three items forming the third concept of government credibility were upside down, with more respondents stating that they believe government at the federal, state and local levels to lack credibility,\" noted Val Smith Ph.D., study director.\nThe survey also found that the public is divided on returning students to the classroom. One-third of respondents want students to return to the classroom while nearly half resist the idea. Among respondents who are parents, however, nearly half favor returning to the classroom, while thirty-eight percent oppose the idea.\nBackground: The study, commissioned by the Healthcare Consumer Rights Foundation, was conducted between July 9 and July 15 . The respondent sample reflects California's ethnicity, partisanship, age, and gender composition. A sample size of 800 yields a sampling error of +/- 3.5%.\nHCRF is a non-profit foundation that provides free education to help healthcare consumers navigate the complex healthcare system and understand their legal rights and options.

One ventilator maker, Medtronic MDT.N , released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.\nThe two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient\u2019s breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person\u2019s comfort.\nThe efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well.

Issues include the lack of polls workers and the fact that the deadline on the books to submit a mail-in ballot doesn't necessarily coincide with the postal service's ability to get the ballot delivered on time.\nPresident Trump, who won all six states in 2016, has repeatedly criticized mail-in voting, suggesting it leads to more fraud. There is no evidence that voting by mail does increase fraud, but Trump's repeated attacks have turned it into a more partisan issue.\nHere is where the six swing states stand on mail-in voting.\nFlorida\nVoters in Florida have been able to vote absentee without having to cite an excuse since 2002. Trump, who changed his residency from New York to Florida last year, has used Florida's mail-in voting system.\nFlorida Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee (R) told reporters Tuesday that combined voter turnout was \"higher than average\" in the state's primary this week. She said in-person voting was \"light to medium\" with an increase in mail-in ballots compared to previous elections.\nThe increase in mail-in voting coincided with early preliminary results for most of the contested primary races.\n\"Today was not the finish line,\" Lee said. \"We still have much work to do to prepare for November's Presidential Election, to ensure that voters are registered and aware of their voting options.\"\nFlorida has more experience with mail-in voting than some other swing states. In 2018, 30.9 percent of Florida voters voted by mail, according to the Election Assistance Commission.\nElection officials in Florida do not begin counting any ballots until polls close on Election Day.\nTrump narrowly won Florida's 29 electoral votes in 2016 but recent polls show Biden slightly ahead.\nArizona\nThe majority of voters in Arizona have already cast mail-in ballots in previous elections, making them used to the process, according to Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D).\nShe announced in March that the state is sending mail-in voting applications to every registered voter who is not already on the state's permanent vote by mail list.\n\"We're fortunate in Arizona that we've had vote-by-mail for a longtime so the infrastructure to do mass vote-by-mail is already in place,\" Hobbs said at a Tuesday webinar hosted by the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State.\nAccording to Hobbs, 78 percent of voters in the 2018 midterms chose to vote early. In the August primaries, 88 percent did so. She expects early voting and general turnout to increase in November as well.\n\"We have to be really diligent about continuing to put out the information about how this system works,\" Hobbs said.\nLike virtually every other state this election cycle, Arizona is facing a potential shortage of poll workers and volunteers. In previous years poll workers were only able to work polls in the county they reside in, though the state has tweaked their laws to allow poll workers to be deployed across the state.\nElection officials in Arizona begin counting ballots two weeks before Election Day.\nTrump won Arizona's 11 electoral votes by 4 percentage points in 2016, though Biden narrowly leads in recent polls.\nWisconsin\nWisconsin's 3.4 million registered voters have been able to request a mail-in ballot without providing an excuse for years.\nIn May, the Wisconsin Elections Commission approved a plan to send absentee ballot applications to more than 2.7 million registered voters.\nTurnout for presidential elections in Wisconsin hovers at around 3 million, election officials told The Hill. In 2016, 819,316 voters in Wisconsin voted absentee, but less than 18 percent of those absentee voters did so by mail.\nMost absentee ballots cast in previous years were done in the municipal clerk's office in the weeks before the election, not by mail.\nIn April, 1.1 million of the 1.55 million ballots cast in the state's primary were by mail. As of this week there are already more than 800,000 absentee ballot requests on file for November.\nWisconsin election officials begin counting ballots after the polls open on Election Day. Having to process so mail-in ballots in a short period of time has led municipalities to rent or buy additional voting machines to feed the absentee ballots into while in-person voters still use the other machines, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported.\nTrump narrowly won Wisconsin's 10 electoral college votes in 2016.\nMichigan\nRegistered voters in Michigan have traditionally had to request mail-in ballot forms but this year Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) sent all registered voters applications ahead of the August primary and November general election.\nBenson said at a Tuesday webinar hosted by the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State that Michigan anticipates 1.5 million citizens will be voting by mail for the first time this November.\nBensen said that in the August primary, more than 10,000 mail-in ballots were rejected, of which 6,000 were postmarked on the primary day but received the day after. Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, she noted.\nFor that reason, Bensen's office has asked the state legislature to change the laws so the state could accept ballots postmarked on Election Day. In the meantime, she is urging voters to submit ballots early.\n\"If that doesn't change and nothing else changes we're facing a scenario where we could have to reject a number of otherwise valid votes that are delayed through no fault of the voter ... and that number could exceed the margin of victory in a number of races,\" Bensen said.\nIn 2018, 24.3 percent of Michigan's voters voted by mail, according to the Election Assistance Commission. As of this week 2.5 million people in Michigan were registered to vote by mail, Bensen said.\nMichigan election officials can begin counting ballots at any time on Election Day.\nNorth Carolina\nThe North Carolina general assembly changed their laws this year to allow for only one witness signature instead of two in mail-in ballots.\nNorth Carolina elections officials told The Hill they anticipate 30 to 40 percent of voters who cast ballots will vote by mail in 2020. In 2016, only 4.2 percent of voters cast ballots through mail.\nLike in Michigan, election officials are urging voters to mail their ballots in before the deadline that's on the books.\n\"The deadline set 40 years ago has been unrealistic for years,\" Wake County Elections Board commissioner Gerry Cohen tweeted. \"Voters will have best success if they get an absentee request to (their) county by Oct. 15.\"\nNorth Carolina ballots received by mail after Election Day will be counted only if they are received no later than 5 p.m. on the third day following the election and postmarked on or before Election Day. Election officials in North Carolina begin counting ballots two weeks before Election Day.\nTrump won North Carolina in 2016 by 3.6 percentage points and took the state's 15 electoral college votes.\nPennsylvania\nMost Pennsylvania voters who participated in the June 2 primary did so by mail, which led to delayed results, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.\nAn analysis by the Inquirer found that thousands of ballots were not counted because they arrived too late. Only 76 percent of ballots mailed in the three weeks before the election were counted, the paper found.\nThe Pennsylvania Department of State released a report this month asking the Legislature to require counties to distribute mail-in ballots earlier. Elections officials are required to begin mailing ballots to voters no later than 14 days before an election, but the department has now recommended 28 days.\nSecretary of State Kathy Boockvar announced on July 31 that it would provide postage-paid envelopes for mail-in voters using money allocated by Congress in the CARES Act.\nBoockvar has said she expects as many as half of the state's voters to vote by mail in November. In 2018, just 3.7 percent of the state's voters voted by mail, according to the Election Assistance Commission.\nTrump won Pennsylvania by less than one percentage point in 2016 and its 20 electoral votes were crucial to his victory."}, {"RECORDID": "20200710-13208", "label": 0, "title": "Trump: Doctors Were \u2018Very Surprised\u2019 I \u2018Aced\u2019 Cognitive Test", "body": "President Donald Trump boasted on Thursday night about a cognitive test he took during a Walter Reed physical, telling Fox News host Sean Hannity that doctors were \u201cvery surprised\u201d that he \u201caced\u201d it while calling on former Vice President Joe Biden to take the same test.\nCalling in to close confidant Hannity\u2019s primetime program, both the president and the Fox News star began openly questioning Biden\u2019s mental fitness and suggesting he is suffering from cognitive decline.\nAfter Hannity aired a montage of selectively edited clips to characterize Biden as senile, and Trump described the former vice president as \u201cbrainwashed,\u201d the conservative host brought up Biden\u2019s recent claim that he \u201ccan hardly wait\u201d to test his cognitive capability against Trump\u2019s.\n\u201cNow he apparently says that he has many cognitive tests,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cHe\u2019s tested all the time, cognitively.

The market is projected to grow with a CAGR of 9.5% from 2019-2027.\nThe liquid biopsy market is growing primarily due to government and global health organizations initiatives. Restraining factors, such as low sensitivity of liquid biopsy, is likely to damage the growth of the market in the coming years. On the other hand, rising liquid biopsy due to growing application and advancements is expected to have a positive impact on the growth of the Europe liquid biopsy market in the coming years.\nLiquid biopsy is a revolutionary technology that is opening up various perspectives. The technology consists of isolation and detection of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and exosomes, which provides genomic information of the cancer patients. Liquid biopsy are used in cancer diagnosis in order to study response or resistance to given treatments.\nThe liquid biopsy test is conducted to detect cancer at an early stage. The test is performed either on a blood sample to identify cancer cells present in the in blood stream, or on the DNA extracted from tumor cells. The government for early detection of cancer takes various initiatives. For instance, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) started a new initiative called Pre-competitive Collaboration on Liquid Biopsy for Early Cancer Assessment.\nEuropean countries are also taking initiatives for early detection of cancer. For instance, the Innovative Medicines Initiative funded the CANCER-ID project, started on 1January 2015. It is a public-private partnership between the EU and the European pharmaceutical industry, which includes 38 partners from 13 European countries, along with groups from the US and a company in Singapore . These partners are brought together to develop and validate standardized operating procedures for liquid biopsies. Such increasing initiatives for liquid biopsy, it is likely to boost the growth of the global liquid biopsy market during the forecast period.\nIn 2019, the reagents & kits segment accounted for the largest market share in the Europe liquid biopsy market based on the product & services, and the similar segment is estimated to mark the highest CAGR in the market during the forecast period, owing to the availability of complete set of kits for liquid biopsy.\nHowever, due to growing COVID-19, the supply of diagnostics kits and assays are delayed because of growing quarantine time and shutting down all business operations. Europe is facing the massive impact of an outbreak due to exponential growth of infections in the region. As per data published by public sources, till March 26 , Europe had an estimated 250,000 number of infected patients in the region.

Millions of people have lost their jobs, largely those who work on daily wages and have fled to their homes in the countryside.\nSeveral states have called for an extension saying they would not be able to deal with a surge of cases.

By the end of the year, it will achieve 5G network coverage in areas with industry application needs.\nThe sprout of the \"new infrastructure\", represented by 5G technology, brings new opportunities for the traditional construction machinery industry chain.\nSANY HEAVY INDUSTRY CO., LTD., headquartered in Changsha , enjoys a reputation of \"intelligent factory\" as it owns the national intelligent manufacturing demonstration factory. In this factory, \"5G+ intelligent manufacturing\" robot giants work nonstop. They are working in almost all of the procedures, from goods collecting, transferring, parts assembling, to painting, drying, detecting and warehousing, etc. SANY and its partners are now working together to develop innovative 5G intelligent manufacturing application. In the future, 5G will be applied in detection, equipment maintenance and key station monitoring.\nSANY, ZOOMLION, CRCC and SUNWARD, these four world-top 50 construction machinery enterprises stand as the golden brands in Changsha industry chain. Facing with the increasing competition in the global market and the impact of the epidemic, leading manufacturing enterprises such as SANY are enabling traditional construction machinery through 5G+ industrial internet, making the construction machinery industry chain \"strong\" and boosting the transformation from \"made in Changsha \" to \"intelligently made in Changsha \".\nSince 2017, Changsha has been making great efforts to deploy the strategy of \"promoting the manufacturing industry with the emerging industry chain\". On the basis of the 16 original industry chains, such as construction machinery and modern seed industry, 6 more chains, such as automobile and bio-pharmaceutical, have been added, making it clear to develop the \"22 emerging and advantageous industry chains\". Thanks to these good policies, large quantities of high-quality projects of emerging industries have been set up in Changsha , leading a prosperity to all industries.\nYUANPIN BIOTECH stands as a great example of the emerging bio-pharmaceutical chain. It is the largest cell tissue bank in Hunan and the only large-scale enterprise for stem cell application in Changsha bio-pharmaceutical industry chain. It's project Clinical Demonstration of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Treated with Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells that has been approved as the first batch by the Science and Technology Department of Hunan Province, while it has only been settled in Changsha Economic and Technological Development Zone for less than one year. Numerous preparations of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells are produced day and night and sent for critical patients in Hubei province.\nThe bio-pharmaceutical chain members should always keep eyes on the research of cutting-edge technologies and core products, while not neglect the transformation of scientific and technological achievements and product marketing. YUANPIN BIOTECH has been cooperated with Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanhua University to conduct clinical treatment and projects regarding stem cells, which covers a wide range of clinical treatment including Parkinson. These activities give powerful supplements to the weakness of the whole industry chain and further extend the chain and value of bio-pharmaceutical industry.\nThe advantages of industrial development formed by \"strengthening the chain\" and \"supplementing the chain\" are bringing new momentum to Changsha . According to government figures, in the first half of this year, 63 major projects with an investment of more than 200 million yuan were introduced into 22 industry chains in Changsha , including two \"10 billion level projects\" and four \"5- 10 billion yuan projects\", with a total planned investment of 103.2 billion yuan .\nImage Attachments Links: Link: http://asianetnews.net/view-attachment?attach-id=368519  Caption: A sorting robot is working at SANY No.18 factory in Changsha .\nLink: http://asianetnews.net/view-attachment?attach-id=368525 Caption: At the on-site meeting of \"5G+ industrial internet\" in Hunan Province , the enterprise leaders are watching the \"5G+ 360 degree factory\" monitoring system at SANY No.18 factory.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/changsha-the-development-of-emerging-industry-chain-stimulates-driving-forces-recovery-301104603.html\nSOURCE The Industry and Information Technology Department of Hunan Province"}, {"RECORDID": "20200404-52512", "label": -1, "title": "Soaring unemployment increases odds U.S. banks will cut dividends | Reuters", "body": "By David Henry\n4 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Questions are building about whether big U.S. banks will have to cut dividends later this year as the coronavirus crisis puts a record portion of Americans out of work, making it difficult for borrowers to pay back loans.\nWall Street analysts were initially skeptical that U.S. lenders would have to follow European counterparts and non-financial companies that have already done so, but in recent days, some have started to take the possibility more seriously.\nBanks that have heavy exposure to credit cards are most at risk, they said.\nThose lenders, including Citigroup Inc C.N , JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Capital One Financial Corp COF.N , may breach Federal Reserve limits on using capital for dividends when loan losses escalate and erode profits.\n\u201cOne of the most important variables that will determine whether banks have adequate capital to maintain dividends is the extent to which consumers draw down on outstanding credit-card lines,\u201d Goldman Sachs bank analyst Richard Ramsden said in a report on Thursday.\nCredit cards have an \u201coutsized impact,\u201d Ramsden said, because lenders have extended some $2 trillion in those loans to consumers, and performance is so closely tied to unemployment.\nCard loan loss rates may double under severe economic stress, and be more than three times the rate on commercial loans, he said.\nOn balance, however, \u201call of the banks should be in a position to maintain dividends at, or close to, the current run rate,\u201d he said.\nDividends are seen as evidence of good financial health and encourage loyalty from investors who expect that income, which makes companies leery of cutting them.\nHowever, nearly 10 million Americans have filed jobless claims as the coronavirus has shut down retail stores, restaurants and other businesses deemed \u201cnon-essential\u201d across the country.\nEconomists expect the unemployment rate may eventually spike as high as 20% and U.S. economic output fall as much as 34% before the country can get back to normal.\nThe European Central Bank told their lenders on March 27 to skip dividends and share buybacks until at least October, estimating they could save 30 billion euros by doing so.\nAlthough major U.S. banks already halted share repurchases through June to conserve capital, they face political pressure from Democratic lawmakers, prominent former regulators and some economic commentators to cut dividends as well.\nBanks have so far resisted those calls, arguing that they are financially stronger than European banks.\n\u201cOur dividend is sound,\u201d Citigroup Chief Executive Mike Corbat told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cWe plan on continuing to pay it.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N CEO David Solomon and Morgan Stanley MS.N CEO James Gorman made similar statements in television interviews this week.\nBehind the scenes, however, dividends have increasingly become a top agenda item, an industry lobbyist told Reuters, with bankers discussing what they should do and whether they should coordinate any action.\nA main concern is that suspending dividends will hurt share prices at a time when stocks are already under intense stress, the person said, asking not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.\nThe industry may have no choice if banks get too close to the Fed\u2019s limits on capital use for dividends, analysts said. That could happen as soon as the second half of this year, particularly for major card lenders, as delinquencies and loan-loss provisions increase, Ramsden said.\nIf unemployment reaches 10%, banks might report less in quarterly profits than they planned to pay out in dividends, Oppenheimer & Co analyst Chris Kotowski said.\nReporting by David Henry in New York; Additional reporting by Michelle Price in Washington.; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Sonya Hepinstall\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200717-46231", "label": 1, "title": "Gabon appoints first woman prime minister Ossouka Raponda", "body": "The president of Gabon, Ali Bongo Ondimba, has appointed the country's first female prime minister, Rose Christiane Ossouka Raponda.\nOssouka Raponda, 56, was promoted from the defence ministry and takes over from Julien Nkoghe Bekale, who was appointed prime minister in January 2019.\nShe is an economist by training who graduated from the Gabonese Institute of Economy and Finance, specialising in public finance.\nIn 2012, she first became budget minister and then the first female mayor of the capital Libreville in 2014, as a candidate for Bongo's Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG).\nIn a statement, the president's office said her mission will include \"ensuring Gabon's economic relaunch and necessary social support in the light of the world crisis linked to COVID-19\".\nHeavily dependent on income from oil, the central African state has been badly hit by the slump in the price of crude oil as well as the impact of the new coronavirus on trade.\nOssouka Raponda's appointment comes at a time when opposition and civil society leaders are once more openly questioning Bongo's fitness to govern after he suffered a stroke in October 2018.\nHe spent months abroad for treatment, and during this time the country was rocked by an attempted coup in January 2019.\nThe putsch bid lasted only a matter of hours, but was followed by a reshuffle that installed Nkoghe Bekale as prime minister and Ossouka Raponda as defence minister.\nSeveral months later, the authorities launched a vast anti-corruption drive that led to the incarceration of Bongo's right-hand man Brice Laccruche Alihanga and 20 associates, including four former ministers.\nBongo was elected in 2009 after the death of his father Omar who led the country for 42 years.

Lamar Alexander, one of the last of the genteel Republican moderates in the chamber. And the race to replace him has turned into perhaps the ugliest Republican primary in the country \u2014 with spurious super PAC attacks, Mitt Romney being invoked as a slur and President Donald Trump lining up on opposite sides as Sen. Ted Cruz.\nThe race was never supposed to be competitive: The Trump-backed candidate, Bill Hagerty \u2014 who served as the president\u2019s ambassador to Japan \u2014 was on a glide path. Trump endorsed Hagerty before he even left Tokyo or entered the race. But as the contest has tightened in the run-up to the Aug. 6 election, Hagerty's main opponent, Manny Sethi, has found traction by claiming to be the true, unapologetic Trumpian conservative in the race \u2014 while blasting Hagerty as a squishy, Mitt Romney-loving phony.\nHagerty largely ignored Sethi most of the race \u2014 seemingly confident of his lead which his internal polls had at 17 points \u2014 until earlier this month, when he abruptly went on the offensive. His recent campaign speeches and interviews are chock-full of attack lines. His campaign has dubiously accused Sethi of donating money to a group \" bankrolling these rioters \" in an ad with a wounded veteran telling voters that Sethi can't be trusted to defend the flag.\nAnd Hagerty has been repeatedly mispronouncing Sethi's name as \"Set-ee\" instead of \"Seth-ee\" a year into the race, even in response to reporter questions with the correct pronunciation. Hagerty told POLITICO it was inadvertent, and he didn't know which pronunciation Sethi, the son of Indian immigrants, prefers.\n\u201cBill Hagerty is Thurston Howell III without the charm,\" said Jordan Gehrke, Sethi's senior strategist, comparing Hagerty to the out-of-touch millionaire in the '60s-era sitcom \"Gilligan's Island.\" \"He\u2019s desperate. He should be.\u201d Sethi's own internal poll released earlier this month showed the race within 2 points.\nRep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), who endorsed Hagerty, shot back that Sethi\u2019s recent attacks were \u201cfiction. I think it\u2019s despair,\u201d he said.\nThe outcome almost certainly has no bearing on the makeup of the Senate, with Republicans strongly favored to retain the seat in November. But the battle is a window into the changing nature of the Republican Party, in which economic populism is in vogue, and race and identity have been thrust to the fore.\nMany ambitious Republicans eager to position themselves as future leaders of the party have picked sides. Last week, Cruz endorsed Sethi, joining Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Two other 2024 presidential prospects, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, have lined up behind Hagerty, with Cotton's super PAC set to make its first 2020 expenditure to attack Sethi .\nThe brawl between the two candidates escalated when Sethi went after Hagerty over his support of Romney in 2008 and 2012, branding him as a \"Mitt Romney Republican\" \u2014 scarlet letters in Trump\u2019s GOP.\nSince then, the race has devolved into a gnarly thicket of misleading attacks: Sethi's campaign is running an ad that claims Hagerty is endorsed by Mitt Romney, even though the Utah senator hasn't endorsed and Hagerty has denounced him aggressively on the trail. Hagerty's team has accused Sethi of donating money to a group supporting the rioters, a distortion of a $50 contribution in 2008 Sethi made to a Democratic congressional candidate in Virginia that was processed by ActBlue, a party-aligned payment platform that has been used recently by Black Lives Matter-linked groups and other protestors.\nHagerty, a former private equity executive and Jeb Bush delegate, was the sort of business-first conservative who donated to both Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000, mirroring some of Trump's political donating habits before his presidential run. But in 2020, he has run on a message tailored for the Trump era, telling POLITICO that Black Lives Matter is an \u201canti-Semitic\u201d and \u201cMarxist\u201d organization that\u2019s \u201ccalling for the removal of the images of Jesus Christ.\u201d In a recent direct-to-camera ad, Hagerty declared : \"Burn our flag or destroy a monument, you go to prison.\" He's leaning heavily on Trump's endorsement, which came in a presidential tweet .\n\u201cI think the very first issue is supporting President Trump,\u201d Hagerty said. \u201cThat's the big issue here in Tennessee. Folks in Tennessee want a candidate that's going to support \u2014 they want a senator that's going to support President Trump and his agenda.\u201d\nSethi, a physician and political newcomer, has used $1.9 million of his own wealth to amplify his message bashing the economic lockdowns and racial justice protests. \u201cChurch with too many people is a crime. Thousands of people protesting is not,\u201d went one viral ad. \u201cYou got a problem with any of that? You\u2019re a racist, and you want to kill Grandma.\u201d\nHagerty has fought back with his own barrage of ads, taking loans of at least $6.5 million to fund his campaign, according to FEC records.\nThey have both continued in-person campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic even as many campaigns have retreated. Masks are provided and encouraged but not required at Sethi's events, many of which were packed indoors this past weekend. \u201cWe try to encourage social distancing \u2014 but when your crowds are growing and growing, it becomes more challenging,\u201d Sethi told POLITICO.\nSethi has drawn attention for his unapologetic and provocative TV ads that try to ride a conservative backlash to the recent Black Lives Matter protests. One accused liberals of not really caring about Black lives because Planned Parenthood places clinics near minority communities, and asking voters if they are sick of liberals saying \u201cwatching American cities get ripped apart is a chance for you to examine your privilege.\u201d\nWhile Hagerty has brandished his Trump endorsement, Sethi has pounded him for his links to Romney. Hagerty worked with Romney in private equity and served on both of his presidential campaigns, including as national finance chair in 2008. He defends his 2012 work as an effort to defeat Barack Obama, whom he calls the \u201cworst president\u201d of his lifetime, but condemns the Utah senator's recent politics.\nHagerty's response suggests Romney, who preceded Trump as the GOP's presidential nominee, has now become toxic in Republican primary politics. Hagerty frequently bashes him on the trail and told POLITICO that Romney\u2019s disagreements with Trump negatively impacted his own job as ambassador. Unprompted, he also called Romney \u201cirresponsible\u201d for marching with Black Lives Matter protesters recently.\nSethi was unconvinced.\n\u201cI just think someone like that really has no place in the Republican Party anymore, and Bill Hagerty represents that,\u201d said Sethi. \u201cNow he\u2019s trying to hide it.\u201d\nRomney hasn\u2019t officially endorsed Hagerty or weighed in on his behalf, other than saying he would \"love it\" if Hagerty entered the race last year, according to the Wall Street Journal .\nJack Johnson, the GOP leader in the state Senate who endorsed Hagerty, said if anyone would be concerned about his past relationship with Romney, it would be Trump himself.\n\u201cI think he's convinced that any past support or relationship with Mitt Romney is water under the bridge and not really relevant right now because he's obviously 100 percent supporting President Trump, and vice versa,\u201d Johnson said.\nTom Ingram, a former Alexander chief of staff, said that even with declining national approval ratings, Tennessee is \u201cstill a Trump \u2014 all caps, underlined, italicized \u2014 state, and Romney is a frontline Trump enemy.\u201d In large part because of the president\u2019s endorsement, Ingram added that \u201cI think it would be a pretty stunning upset if Hagerty lost.\u201d\nHagerty has support from more than a dozen senators and has long-held relationships with Tennessee Republican officials stretching back years, both before and after he served as a top adviser to former Gov. Bill Haslam. Dozens of current and former members of the state legislature endorsed him alongside the president and his allies. Hagerty also rolled out endorsements from Vice President Mike Pence and Fox News host Sean Hannity in the closing stretch of the race.\nAs with most other Republican primaries across the country this year, support for \u2014 and from \u2014 Trump has been central, although a few of his endorsed candidates have lost in recent primaries.\nFleischmann, who has endorsed Hagerty, said Trump\u2019s backing was \u201cgolden,\u201d and that the president discussed Hagerty and the race with him multiple times last year. Trump keeps regular contact with Hagerty: They spoke by phone last week, and the president held a tele-conference with Hagerty the week before to rally supporters ahead of early voting. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a real primary here, and the other side is spending a lot of money. But Bill is somebody that will never, ever let you down,\u201d Trump said, adding that Hagerty \u201cwas one of my earliest supporters,\u201d despite his support for other primary candidates in 2016.\nHagerty\u2019s campaign publicly shrugged off the challenge at first \u2014 from Sethi and another self-funder, perennial candidate George Flinn \u2014 and released an internal poll earlier this month showing them up 17 points. But last week, the Hagerty campaign abruptly shifted gears and began pounding Sethi as \u201cMassachusetts Manny\u201d and trying to tie him to Obama because he applied for a nonpartisan White House fellowship in 2009.\nOn mispronouncing Sethi\u2019s last name on the stump, Hagerty says the slight is unintentional.\n\u201cI'm just not sure what his preferred pronunciation is, but there's nothing underlying it,\u201d Hagerty said.\n\u201cHow many years of higher education at Vanderbilt does it take to properly pronounce a last name?,\u201d Jeri Thompson, the wife of the late Tennessee senator Fred Thompson who has endorsed Sethi, shot back. \u201cFor shame, Ambassador Hagerty.\u201d\nAsked if he thought Hagerty was deliberately mispronouncing his name to make him sound more foreign, Sethi said, \u201cI think that [voters] can make that judgment for themselves.\u201d\nThe attacks have trickled down to the staff level.

The ways we socialize, exercise, work, travel, consume and trade have been updated, like new software on our devices. The majority of our interactions and transactions have moved to digital platforms. We are now more in harmony with the technologies we have created, blurring the line between virtual and physical. As the world evolves toward this new reality, the facilitation, regulation and security of digital services is increasingly important.\nOvercoming the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will require international coordination on an unprecedented scale. As president of the G20, Saudi Arabia has a crucial role in overseeing cooperation between member countries and the rest of the world in finding global solutions. An extraordinary meeting of G20 digital economy ministers on April 30 chaired by Abdullah Al-Swaha, Saudi minister of communication and IT, discussed how to deploy digital communication technologies in the fight against COVID-19. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, minister of health, joined to discuss the role of digital technologies in health care. It was agreed that digital capacities should be expanded, in particular access to affordable, secure broadband, to underserviced areas and vulnerable people. In addition, all available digital capacities should support health care systems and local small businesses, and protect global supply chains.\nThe response of Saudi Arabia\u2019s leadership to the coronavirus was swift and decisive, and probably saved thousands of lives. As policy makers and regulators, it is CITC\u2019s job to ensure that data and digital services are deployed in a transparent, secure, and ethical manner across all platforms. Saudi Arabia ranks second in the G20 for spectrum liberalization and CITC has worked closely with network operators to boost services as data consumption surges.\nBefore the global lockdown, the average person in Saudi Arabia consumed 600MB of data per day, twice the world average. This has grown to over 920MB per day, which shows how critical it is to maintain healthy and secure digital communications. We recently increased our mobile data frequencies by 50 percent to meet the demand.\n Looking forward, Saudi Arabia is well prepared for a more digitized economy.\n Dr. Mohammed Al-Tamimi\nCITC has worked with other government entities to digitize vital sectors including health and education. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, we gave free access to e-health so it does not consume data from the user\u2019s internet plan whether via the app or website. This allows the ministry to detect and track COVID-19 cases and provide treatment. In education, the government enabled free access to e-learning applications and waived data costs for university students using educational platforms. The volume of services provided by government agencies since the start of the lockdown increased by 70 percent from the same period last year.\nCOVID-19 has also underscored the need for an efficient delivery infrastructure. CITC has implemented new policies to provide the best services while safeguarding people\u2019s rights. During curfew, all registered delivery companies were permitted to work around the clock. Ten new delivery apps were registered, bringing the total to 26, and new regulations set to ensure the safety of providers and users. Delivery drivers must be equipped with personal protective equipment and pass daily health checks. Social distancing and e-payment are mandatory.\nLooking forward, Saudi Arabia is well prepared for a more digitized economy. In the past three years the government and private sector have invested over $15 billion in ICT infrastructure. Internet services now cover 99 percent of the country and 3 million homes have fiber broadband. Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries to offer 5G, and has installed 6,800 5G and 28,000 4G network towers serving 30 percent and 91 percent of the population respectively. We rank 12th globally and 5th in the G20 for mobile internet speed, which leaves us well positioned for the new digital era.\nAdapting to this new reality will allow us to live in a safer, healthier, better informed and efficient world. It is the duty of regulators such as CITC to ensure the quality and security of the digital services we find ourselves increasingly reliant on. We will continue working with other local and international regulators, and the private sector, to guarantee the best user experience and to unlock the huge potential of the new digital economy.\n\u2022 Dr. Mohammed Al-Tamimi is governor of the Saudi Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC)"}, {"RECORDID": "20200814-55839", "label": -1, "title": "U.S. Postal Service watchdog to probe service woes as worries rise about mail ballots | Reuters", "body": "By Andy Sullivan , David Shepardson\n5 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service\u2019s internal watchdog is investigating cost cutting that has slowed delivery and alarmed lawmakers ahead of a presidential election when up to half of U.S. voters could cast ballots by mail, a congressional aide said on Friday.\nThe Postal Service\u2019s inspector general also will examine possible conflicts of interest involving new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who has donated $2.7 million to President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, according to Saloni Sharma, a spokeswoman for Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who requested the investigation.\nDeJoy owns millions of dollars in stock in Postal Service rivals and customers, according to a financial disclosure form filed by his wife.\nThe Inspector General\u2019s Office is \u201cconducting a body of work to address concerns raised,\u201d spokeswoman Agapi Doulaveris said\nThe investigation comes as the Postal Service is warning states there is \u201csignificant risk\u201d voters will not have enough time to complete and return their ballots.

The progressive South American country of 3.4 million has the region\u2019s lowest rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and it never shut down its economy entirely.\nUruguay was one of the Western Hemisphere\u2019s first countries to send its students back to school, using a staged approach.\nIn late April, Uruguay reopened schools in rural areas, where the student population is small. In early June, it brought vulnerable student groups, which were struggling to access online learning, and high school seniors back into classrooms. Then all students in non-urban areas went back to classrooms.\nFinally, on June 29, 256,000 students in the capital of Montevideo returned to school. An alternating schedule of in-person and virtual instruction reduces the number of students in classrooms at one time.\nUruguay is notable for residents\u2019 consistent and early adoption of measures like social distancing and masks. Its successful pandemic response comes despite its proximity to hard-hit Brazil, where schools remain closed.\nA school official greets a student during the first day of the final phase of reopening schools in Montevideo, Uruguay.\nThere is no perfect way to reopen schools during a pandemic. Even when a country has COVID-19 under control, there\u2019s no guarantee that schools can reopen safely.\nBut the policies and practices of countries that have had some initial success with schools point in the same direction. It helps to slowly stage the reopening. Strict mask wearing and social distancing is critical, both in schools and surrounding communities. And both officials and families need reliable and up-to-date data so that they can continually assess outbreaks\u2014and change course quickly if necessary.\nThat complicates school reopenings in the U.S., with its soaring COVID-19 cases, limited testing capacity and decentralized education system. Most countries have national education systems. In the U.S., school officials in all 50 states must sort through the same politicized messaging and confusing data as everyone else to make their own decisions about whether, when and how to welcome back students.\nBob Spires is an assistant professor of education at the University of Richmond\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

The scheme is already the least adequate in the world to cover the future living cost of people after their retirement.\nPeter Shiu Ka-fai, a lawmaker who represents the wholesale and retail sectors in Hong Kong, urged the government to allow the 2.9 million Hongkongers covered by the MPF to withdraw some of their savings to meet their urgent financial needs.\n\u201cMany companies have cash flow problems while many employees may lose their jobs,\u201d Shiu said. \u201cUnder such special circumstances, the government should adopt this one-off measure to allow people to tap some of their MPF to cope with their financial problems.\u201d\n\u201cThe government should also consider contributing the MPF for both the employer and employee for a six months to help relieve their burden.\u201d\nThe Australian government will allow people facing financial stress to withdraw up to A$20,000 (US$11,580) of their pension savings in the next four months. The move is part of a sweeping package announced on Sunday to combat the economic havoc caused by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a Bloomberg report.\nIt will put as much as A$27 billion back into the pockets of working Australians, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.\nMalaysia also unveiled a similar plan on Monday, allowing members of the state-managed pension fund to make monthly withdrawals for up to a year to ease their financial burden. The move could put about 40 billion ringgit (US$9 billion) of their savings back into their pockets, it said.\nThe government is also giving employees the option to lower their mandatory contribution from next month in order increase their disposable income, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said in a televised announcement, promising more stimulus later this month.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has infected over 445,000 people globally and forced large swathes of the population to stay home.\nThe contagion, which has infected more than 410 people in Hong Kong, has ground much economic activity to a halt, with almost all tourists deterred from visiting, many events cancelled, and shops, restaurants and other venues struggling as people refrain from going out.\nThe Hong Kong government is not in favour of this option, a government source told the South China Morning Post . There are legal issues surrounding the early withdrawal of MPF savings, which are meant for retirement protection only, the source said.\nIt may need several years of lengthy process to change the law which is not the quickest way to help the employees, the source added. Other relief, such as the government\u2019s promised HK$10,000 (US$1,290) cash handout to all permanent residents, is more effective, he said.\nHong Kong has no unemployment insurance which has made lives harder for those who have lost their jobs. The unemployment rate soared to 3.7 per cent at the end of February, with 134,000 people losing their jobs. The government has warned the jobless rate may go up to 5 per cent, leaving 180,000 people without work.\nThe source said it was important to note that the MPF, with assets worth about HK$1 trillion, is much smaller than the Australian pension scheme.\nAustralia\u2019s had assets of A$2.9 trillion as of the end of June 2019, making it the world\u2019s fourth-biggest pension fund, 13 times bigger than Hong Kong\u2019s. Australia requires employers to pay 9.5 per cent of the staff member\u2019s salary per month while the employee can make a voluntary contribution.\nIn Malaysia, the Employees Provident Fund had about 839 billion ringgit in accumulated contributions at the end of 2018. Employees set aside 11 per cent of their pay to the fund every month while employers chip in 12 to 13 per cent.\nHong Kong\u2019s MPF contribution much less than these scheme and hence it ranks among the least adequate in the world in terms of meeting the future needs of pensioners, among 34 markets in 2018 tracked by Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index.\nThe MPF, established 20 years ago, is a mandatory retirement plan that requires both employer and employee to each contribute 5 per cent of monthly salary up to a combined HK$3,000 per month. Local law stipulates people can only cash it in when they turn 65.\nA spokeswoman for the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA), the pension regulator, said that allowing scheme members to early withdraw their MPF on the ground of financial difficulties does not align with the original objective of the MPF as its purpose is to provide basic retirement protection for the Hong Kong working population.\n\u201cTo address the financial difficulties faced by the SMEs and employees, the MPFA noted that the government has recently launched an array of measures \u2026 which would benefit employees [including] cash payout of HK$10,000 to Hong Kong permanent residents aged 18 or above, with a view to relieving people's financial burden,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\u201cThe government should pay mandatory contribution for both employers and employees for a certain period of time. We can consider the Australian arrangement if unemployment reaches a certain percentage,\u201d said Kenrick Chung, general manager of employee benefits at Realife Insurance Brokers.\nBoth the early withdrawal of MPF savings and a suspension of contributions would require a change of law first, according to Glenn Turner, chief operations officer at independent financial planning company Altruist Financial Group.\nSetting the criteria for whether someone is facing the necessary financial hardship would be complicated, and it will take time to process all the potential applications for withdrawal, he said.\n\u201cOnce the money is withdrawn, for sure people will not redeposit it,\u201d Turner said. \u201cSuspending contributions is not complex and is easy to implement. It can be restarted easily once the crisis is over. This is a revocable option.\u201d\nElvin Yu, chief executive of pension consultancy Goji Consulting, agreed people should be able to access their MPF savings earlier, up to a certain limit.\nChristopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker for the financial services sector, agreed with the proposal to suspend MPF contributions but not the early withdrawal of savings.\n\u201cThe MPF is for retirement protection so better not to use the money for other purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, as many companies and individuals are suffering from the outbreak, it would be good to take a holiday from MPF contributions for three months.\u201d\nMore Articles from SCMP\nOil titan PetroChina\u2019s production plan and budget hang in the balance as coronavirus, oil price war cloud economic outlook\nCoronavirus: British exam board latest to cancel secondary education tests amid global pandemic battle\nHSBC to hit \u2018pause\u2019 on its retrenchment plan and will free hiring as coronavirus pandemic shows no sign of slowing\nCoronavirus: inbound travellers from Europe, US to be issued Bluetooth quarantine wristbands at Hong Kong airport\nA cure for coronavirus cabin fever \u2013 watch zoo webcams, tour Alaskan glaciers or Hawaiian volcanoes virtually, tune into a Rocky Mountains dawn\nThis article originally appeared on the South China Morning Post (SCMP) , the leading news media reporting on China and Asia.

The primary trigger is crude oil prices. Crude temporarily dropped below $15 a barrel, but that has changed. It has risen toward $30. However, that is well below the start of the year when the price was over $60 a barrel.\nPrices have fluctuated based in part on supply from Saudi Arabia and Russia. The coronavirus pandemic has tamped down demand as well. This is another factor in the plunge of prices.\nAAPL\nSTZ\nTSLA\nAMZN\nGasoline prices in the United States collapsed a month ago. Some cities had stations where gas was below $1 a gallon. In several states near the Gulf of Mexico, prices dropped to an average of less than $1.20 for a gallon of regular across the entire state.\nThe prices have rebounded somewhat everywhere. The states with the cheapest gas now have per-gallon prices of under $1.50. The universe of those is dwindling. However, in nine cities, the price is below that.\nThe Gulf States are likely to have the lowest prices throughout the balance of the year. They are near the refineries south of Houston. Prices are depressed by abundant supply and the proximity of gas stations to refineries.\nThe price of gas transportation can affect costs. It is why Hawaii has the highest average gas prices among all states by far.\nThe states that currently have the lowest gas prices , according to GasBuddy, are Mississippi at $1.50 and Oklahoma at $1.51. Just above that, the price in Arkansas is $1.53. The price in Texas is $1.55, and in Alabama the price is $1.56.\nThe national average price for a gallon of regular is $1.88.\nThese low-priced gas states also tend to be in places with very low gas taxes. According to the American Petroleum Institute, the average state gas tax per gallon is $0.5453.\nIn most of the low gas price states, the number is well below that. In Mississippi, the tax level is $0.3719. In Oklahoma and Texas, the figure is $0.3840.\nThe API also points out that the tax trend has helped consumers. Its researchers wrote, \u201cThe nationwide average tax on gasoline is 54.53 cpg, down .17 cpg from the October 2019 study.\u201d\nAt the other end of the state gas tax spectrum, the gas tax in California is $0.790 per gallon. In Pennsylvania, it is $0.771.\nOne reason prices may not snap back above the $2.50 level where it was at the start of the year is lack of demand. As businesses and people continue to be part of the stay-at-home economy, traffic has fallen sharply. In some cities, the level is down by more than half. The volume of customers at gas stations may remain low for months.\nIronically, low gas prices have helped consumers over the years. The price of gas is often a large portion of household expenditures, particularly among lower- and middle-class households.\nAcross the country, the price of gas will remain low, but in some areas, it will be much lower than others.\nALSO READ: 50 Popular Restaurants That Won\u2019t Reopen After the Pandemic"}, {"RECORDID": "20200821-67105", "label": 1, "title": "Feature: Kenyan students keen to join Chinese universities after COVID-19 pandemic", "body": "File photo shows the Chinese Embassy in Kenya hosted a farewell ceremony in Nairobi, Kenya, on Aug. 27, 2019, for students who were to leave for China to pursue studies in Chinese institutions of higher learning.

The Trump administration is now poised to face at least two simultaneous nuclear crises along with an escalating and unprecedented tripartite nuclear-arms race, all of which will threaten the miraculously perfect track record of nuclear deterrence since 1945. Even if there are no nuclear tests or exchanges in the year ahead, the systems, accords, and norms that have helped mitigate the risks of nuclear conflict are vanishing, ushering in a more hazardous era that the United States won\u2019t be able to control.\nConsider what has transpired in the past year alone:\nThese dismal circumstances follow substantial advances in halting the spread of nuclear weapons. In the \u201960s, the decade in which the most new nuclear states emerged (France, China, and unofficially Israel), John F. Kennedy predicted that there would be \u201c15 or 20\u201d nuclear powers by 1975. Today there are nine, a rate of about one to two entrants into the nuclear club per decade, with the latest being North Korea in 2006. The nuclear-security scholar Jim Walsh has noted that three-fourths of countries that were once interested in developing nuclear weapons ultimately chose not to do so, and that since the \u201990s, more states have given up nuclear weapons than acquired them.\nShow of force: Top images from the past week [Photos]\nThe number of nuclear weapons in the world, moreover, has dropped from more than 70,000 in 1986 to fewer than 14,000 today because of arms-control efforts. (That\u2019s still enough, of course, to kill billions of people and envelop the world in a nuclear winter. When it comes to nuclear nonproliferation, progress is only heartening when expressed in relative terms.)\nMost of the reductions in these weapons, however, occurred in the \u201990s, and the pace of cuts has slowed ever since. We now live in a period when the barriers to acquiring nuclear weapons, a 75-year-old technology, are much lower than they once were.

How to decide if the classroom is right for you", "body": "Schools across the country are preparing to welcome back students next month, though the circumstances will be anything but normal during the current pandemic. While schedules will be much different than in past years, class will soon be back in session.\nIn the coming days, many school boards are looking to confirm from families and guardians which children will be returning to the classroom and which will be opting out for remote learning. It can be a daunting decision for many people, especially when there\u2019s so many aspects to consider: How do you know which is best for your child? What happens if you change your mind? What special considerations should you keep in mind when it comes to protocols, like wearing masks and physical distancing?\nConsider the child\u2019s health and stage of development\nJudith Wiener is a professor emerita in the department of applied psychology and human development at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.\nShe says the first thing to be considered when deciding on whether to send children back to school is their age, their developmental stage and their health.\nIf there is an adolescent who\u2019s focused on learning, is independent and adaptive to online classes, it\u2019s a very different situation from someone who has difficulty focusing and needs the social environment.\n\u201cYou're balancing their needs for education,\u201d she tells Yahoo Canada .\nMany school districts are implementing a change to the curriculum, where students have fewer classes per day, several days a week, rather than the full week. This pared-down curriculum could in fact benefit those with learning disabilities.\n\u201cThis may be very advantageous,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least at the secondary level, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re compromising education, and for some special needs kids, this could be helpful.\u201d\nWhen it comes to physical health, a child with a compromised immune system will obviously be more at risk for contracting the virus and bringing it home. It\u2019s also important to consider family members, like grandparents, who live at home who are at higher risk.\nConsider the physical environment\nMany schools are housed in older buildings with poor ventilation. While it\u2019s reasonable to expect students to get outdoor time during the warmer months, considering this is Canada, that\u2019s not a long-term solution. And there could be risk if schools get overcrowded.\nWhen it comes to small children, a significant part of their learning involves play, so the notion of keeping them apart is unrealistic, according to Wiener.\n\u201cTo put anywhere above 15 students in a classroom is unrealistic,\u201d she says.\nConsider everyone\u2019s mental health\nDr. Marshall Korenblum with the University of Toronto\u2019s department of psychiatry says mental health of both the children and parents and guardians need to be thoroughly considered.\nThings like professional work load and support from family members need to be factored into whether sending a child back to school is the best decision.\n\u201cHow are they managing?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat is your stress level as a parent? If it\u2019s high, then consider getting help, whether mental health help or child care help.\u201d\nWiener adds that keeping children at home can also lead to stress-related risks like family violence, or children acting inappropriately out of boredom or lack of discipline. Students might also feel increased anxiety about catching the virus if they go to school.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at mental health problems either way you go when you have this awful situation,\u201d she says.\nWiener suggests teaching young children the pandemic protocols like proper hand-washing and wearing a mask as soon as possible, rather than have it taught in the classroom. She says this could be more compelling if you find a mask the child thinks is cool.\nConsider your community\nKorenblum says this is the one factor that overrides all others when considering sending children back to school: what are the COVID-19 rates in your community?\n\u201cIf you\u2019re surrounded by COVID, schools aren\u2019t in a bubble,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the chances of your kid getting sick is highly dependent on what\u2019s going on in the community. If it\u2019s high, the likelihood is it\u2019s in the school since it\u2019s a microcosm, just a part of the community.\u201d\nIt\u2019s okay to change your mind\nIsaac Bogoch is an infectious diseases physician and scientist in Toronto. He says people should feel okay if they decide to pull their children out of school if circumstances change.\n\u201cThings can change and people might not be comfortable because of an outbreak or an increase of cases or learning something new about the disease,\u201d he says. \u201cThese aren\u2019t static decisions, this is clearly a dynamic situation and the decisions can be dynamic as well.

Where can you find these materials in great quantity? In your homes. In hospitals. And even public transport. The researchers at the National Institutes of Health virology laboratory in Hamilton, Montana have been trying to find an answer to how long the Coronavirus can stick to different commonly used materials and surface types.\nAt the time of writing this, there are 125254 confirmed cases of Coronavirus around the world.

That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d says Marilyn Roberts, a microbiologist at the University of Washington School of Public Health, reports the MIT Technology Review. \u201cVirus stability in air and on surfaces may directly affect virus transmission, as virus particles need to remain viable long enough after being expelled from the host to be taken up by a novel host,\u201d according to Vincent Munster and his team at the National Institutes of Health virology laboratory in Hamilton, Montana.\n\nWhile the Coronavirus likes stainless steel and plastic the most, it doesn\u2019t seem to like copper that much\u2014it is gone from copper in around 4 hours. These findings mean that courier packages, smartphone cases and even containers can become a rather nice host for the Coronavirus as it plots its next move. Health authorities are recommending generous use of hand sanitizers to keep your hands clean, and a regular wipe-down of the surfaces around you could also be quite important. Also, wash your hands regularly with soap, and avoid touching your face with your hands.\nEarlier, the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum in Germany had pointed out that viruses can remain on surfaces and retain their infectious tendencies for up to nine days, in a room temperature environment.

The next, Trump is throwing a veritable kitchen sink of aggressive policies at Beijing in an effort to look tough ahead of the November election.\nIf that kind of belligerent 180 between two world powers seems dangerous to you, that's because it is. Until (and if) Trump leaves office in January, relations between the US and China will be in free fall.\nUp until now Trump has avoided taking a tough stance on China because he's been obsessed with securing a trade deal that would impress his base and supposedly prove how much of a \"dealmaker\" he is. But last week in one of his coronavirus press conferences, Trump told reporters that he was setting the deal aside, opening the door to a more aggressive stance.\nThis abandonment of a further trade deal coincides with a flurry of activity on the China policy front over the last few weeks. We've gone from zero to Mad Max.\nHere's just a smattering of what the Trump administration has done to pivot direction on China over the past few weeks:\nAnd finally last week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a speech at the Nixon Library, replete with historical inaccuracies and hyperbole about the need for the US to turn its back on China and form a new world order of like-minded countries. He said that our country's naive (perhaps greedy) hope that China would become more liberal with our influence should be more than dashed at this point.\n\"President Reagan said that he dealt with the Soviet Union on the basis of 'trust but verify.'\u00a0 When it comes to the CCP, I say we must distrust and verify,\" Pompeo said. \"We, the freedom-loving nations of the world, must induce China to change, just as President Nixon wanted. We must induce China to change in more creative and assertive ways, because Beijing's actions threaten our people and our prosperity.\"\nHow exactly the US will induce China to change is unclear. What Pompeo is describing is hardly a strategy, it's more of an attitude adjustment, and that's not lost on Democrats in Congress. Last week the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had a hearing on the US-China relationship, and Ranking Member Bob Menendez \u2014 like the rest of his Democratic colleagues \u2014 had nothing positive to say about China's behavior. That doesn't mean they think this pivot is wise, though, either.\n\"When China retaliates as it says it will, what will be our next move, and the next move after that,\" Menendez asked. \"This is not a simple two-step dance.\" He called for a \"new era of strategic competition with China\" and \"a new strategic framework.\"\nBut that's not what we're getting here. What we're getting looks less like grand design and more like a Jackson Pollock painting.\nNone of this is lost on China. A former State Department official told me that Chinese officials understand that Trump is at his most dangerous now. He's looking at his flagging poll numbers, the shortening calendar before the election and trying to impress his base. Beijing knows that China hardliners in Congress and the administration see this as their last shot to enact harsh policies before \u2014 what could be\u2014 the end of Trump's time in office.\nConversely, the China hardliners \u2014 who know Trump doesn't actually care about issues like human rights \u2014 think China will use these last few months of the administration to test the boundaries of what Trump will tolerate, even in this more aggressive posture.\nYes, this is extremely dangerous.\nMeanwhile the global economy is on tenterhooks as the coronavirus rips through the United States virtually unchecked. China needs the US market, the US market is on its knees. It would be nice if the two powers could talk this situation out, but as Guggenheim Investments Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd this move from a policy of strategic ambiguity with China to one of open hostility has made cooperation unlikely.\n\"Pre-virus tensions have not disappeared due to the pandemic, they have escalated as blame is being cast on China for both causing and trying to cover up the virus,\" Minerd wrote in a note to clients. \"Anti-China sentiment in the US is bipartisan and as fervent as it has been since about the 1950s. Both President Trump and former Vice President Biden are talking tough on China, and this is likely to lead to a more muscular approach to China that will characterize whichever administration is in power in 2021.\"\nAmerican public opinion is following its leaders. According to an April survey conducted by the Pew Research Center 66% of Americans have an unfavorable view of China, making it even harder for politicians from either side of the aisle to take a softer stance.\nThere are some in the US-China watching business, including former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, who fear \"decoupling\" \u2014 a split between the US and Chinese economies that leaves the world divided into two camps. Some favor partial decoupling , in which the US distances itself from China by cutting off ties in the technology space but maintaining financial relations.\nThere is no precedent for such an arrangement, but there is more than enough precedent for this relationship spinning out of control and imploding. The US-China relationship is a cycle of opening and closing . China opens when it needs outside money and closes when the money isn't worth the outside intrusion.\nOn the American side, there have been people in the US working to keep the door to China open, even just a bit.

Vermont, where he serves as the state's health commissioner, has had the lowest rate of new COVID-19 cases and test positivity in the country for several weeks now. As of Wednesday, there were only three patients hospitalized in the state for the virus, and Vermont's last reported COVID-19 death was on July 28.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's foremost infectious disease expert, touted Vermont's COVID-19 response on Tuesday during a press briefing with Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, saying the state \"should be the model for the country\" on \"opening up the economy in a safe and prudent way.\"\nBut despite the state's success -- and also because of it -- Levine doesn't want Vermonters to let their guard down.\n\"Just because we're in a good place -- we know that this virus is a formidable foe,\" the health commissioner told ABC News.\nAs the fall approaches, bringing anticipated tourism to the state as well as concerns about a \"twindemic\" of COVID-19 and the flu, the state is continuing to follow its playbook for a cautious, data-driven reopening that continually stresses the basics of handwashing, physically distancing and avoiding congregate settings.\nMORE: Colleges forced to reckon with rising COVID-19 cases\nIt's a playbook that officials stress doesn't rely on the state's small size to provide any advantages. Vermont is one of the most rural states in the country, and one of the smallest by population -- though public health experts are quick to dismiss those as playing major parts in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the state.\n\"At first, nationwide, people thought that rural would protect you. \u2026 But that myth was dispelled later on, particularly in the late spring and summer, when all the southern and western states had their surge,\" Levine said. \"Here, we don't believe the rural nature has been protective by any means.\"\n\"Rural helps, but is most definitely not the whole story,\" Dr. Jan Carney, associate dean for public health and health policy at the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine, told ABC News.\nFor the past several weeks, Vermont has had the lowest rate of new cases and test positivity in the country, based on weekly reports from the White House Coronavirus Task Force. In the latest report, dated Sept. 13, Vermont was the only state to be in the \"green zone\" for both cases (indicating fewer than 10 new cases per 100,000 population) and positivity rate (indicating a rate below 5%). \"Vermont continues to have excellent epidemic control,\" the report noted.\nAccording to the state health department, Vermont's positivity rate has held steady at around 0.2% for several months, and it has the lowest rate of total COVID-19 infection in the country, with 261 cases per 100,000 people versus the national average of 1,845 per 100,000.\nLevine noted three factors that have helped Vermont get to this point. For one, the state overall tends to be relatively healthy, he said, pointing to studies by organizations like the Commonwealth Fund. In the foundation's latest scorecard on state health system performance, looking at indicators such as access to health care, quality of care and health outcomes, Vermont ranked fifth in the country.\n\"Vermonters have a history of prioritizing health,\" Levine said. During the pandemic, residents' compliance with behaviors like frequent hand-washing, mask-wearing and social distancing has been \"really paramount,\" he said.\nBur20200723 Covid Testing 02 (Joel Banner Baird/Burlington Free Press via USA Today Network)\nAnother factor: Early in the pandemic, the state knew that it \"needed to actively and proactively protect the most vulnerable,\" Levine said. Among those measures, the state has focused contact tracing and testing efforts in long-term care facilities and offered universal testing at group-living facilities.\nLastly, the state acted quickly to introduce social distancing measures, such as closing schools and restaurants and reducing the size of mass gatherings -- and it didn't start reopening \"until we thought we were at a sufficient level of virus suppression,\" Levine said.\nThe worst of the pandemic in Vermont, by several metrics, was early on. The daily number of reported COVID-19 cases peaked on April 3, and the highest percentage of positive cases, 11%, came in late March, according to data from the health department. The state only started loosening restrictions toward the end of April, as the rate of spread slowed.\n\"Many states have basically just said, 'We're going to just reopen,' and they had lots of virus and high percent positivities when they chose to do that,\" Levine said. \"Our stance was that public health and safety was paramount, and we would reopen when we had suppressed the virus. It was a very cautious reopening, it was a very phased and gradual reopening.\"\nGov. Scott has often likened that approach to incrementally \" turning the spigot \" -- reopening one sector, waiting two weeks and watching the data, and then opening the next sector, and so on.\n\"That's gotten us to where we are, which is a really good place,\" Levine said.\nVermont is among a minority of states to have a centralized public health system, which in this case may have also helped in its pandemic response, public health experts said.\n\"It is a consistent message, and consistent application of policies and consistent ways that we can interact with populations on a local level,\" Levine said.\nFor Carney, who served as the state's commissioner of health from 1989 to 2003, that teamwork between government, medical experts and social service organizations in the state has been crucial.\n\"When something happens like a pandemic, you don't have to develop them new, you build on the relationships that you have,\" Carney said. \"There's this foundation of teamwork and concern about health that has served us well in the past and is one of our absolute strengths right now.\"\nLevine said the state has been leaning on those relationships as it works to address disproportionate rates of COVID-19 cases in Hispanic and African-American populations, including working with community organizations to spread public health messaging.\nVermont has continued to slowly turn the spigot, with K-12 schools and college campuses reopening in recent weeks. The state is in discussions to further open up the hospitality industry, as leaf-peeping and ski seasons approach.\n\"A big threat in Vermont is travel,\" Levine said. \"We want to do it right and still allow people to have a pleasant time and come to Vermont to do what they want to do, and have Vermonters be able to do what they want to do.\"\nLevine said the state plans to offer guidance on a \"thoughtful and cautious\" hospitality reopening soon.\nIn August, the governor also instituted a statewide mask mandate in anticipation of increased travel to Vermont. In announcing the order, Scott said he felt \"we need to act now to protect our gains, which have allowed us to reopen much of our economy.\"\nMORE: How fit and placement influence effectiveness of face masks\nAnother concern for the fall is the flu. Experts are bracing for what some have called a \" twindemic \" of COVID-19 and the flu being active at the same time.\n\"We do really want people to get their flu shot now more than ever,\" Levine said. To that end, he said, the state is trying to make it \"as easy as possible\" to get the vaccine, and is currently working to set up flu shot locations beyond the usual pharmacies and doctor's offices.\nBeing vigilant about behaviors like mask-wearing and social distancing will also continue to be key, experts said.\n\"Don't get careless,\" Fauci advised on Tuesday. \"It's going to be challenging as you get into the fall and the winter, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have a problem if you do the kind of prudent public health measures that you've been doing.\"\nIt's a message that is applicable everywhere, not just Vermont, Carney said.\n\"It's so fundamental -- hand washing and wearing cloth face coverings and keeping physically distant from people whenever possible \u2026 and being able to do that over a long period of time,\" she said. \"It's really important, as the winter comes into play, and as more people are inside, and as we approach flu season -- we have to stick with it and keep working at it for the foreseeable future.\"\nABC News' Olivia Eubanks and Josh Margolin contributed to this report.\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptoms\nTracking the spread in the U.S. and worldwide: Coronavirus map\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\nHow Vermont became a 'model for the country' in responding to the coronavirus pandemic originally appeared on abcnews.go.com"}, {"RECORDID": "20200821-71279", "label": -1, "title": "After dining ban, takeaway waste clutters Hong Kong's pavements, parks and waterways | Reuters", "body": "By Reuters Staff\n3 Min Read\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - A deluge of trash from takeaway containers and disposable cutlery is cluttering the streets and parks of Hong Kong as coronavirus restrictions on dining in restaurants eat away at the city\u2019s capacity to dispose of its garbage.\nThe dining restrictions in the China-ruled Asian financial hub ban eating in any outlet after 6 p.m. At other times in the day, restaurants can only operate at half-capacity and with two people per table.\nAs a result, plastic from eating out has doubled from last year since takeaway food is the only option for many people who do not cook at home.

This column is part of a package on the future of transportation. For more, see Lionel Laurent on how public transportation can spark urban recovery and David Fickling on why passengers will pay the price for the airline industry\u2019s troubles. \nRecently, I caught myself waxing nostalgic about the daily journeys on the London Underground that I abandoned just before lockdown. Only a few months ago, I was that middle-aged woman inching onto an indecently crowded commuter carriage, stuck for what seemed like an eternity under some tall person\u2019s sweaty armpit, gripping a germ-covered pole as the car rumbled and jerked through a dark tunnel. Overcrowding and ear-splitting noise levels on the Tube made some journeys torture. There are laws against animals crammed so tightly into an enclosure.\nEven so, I miss it. My trip on the Tube had served both to separate work and home spaces and bridge them. The commute provided time to scan a morning newsletter or listen to a podcast. I could be lost in thought, buried in my phone or take in a visual smorgasbord of pinstripe suits and body piercings. Its familiar rules and conventions \u2014 the\u00a0command to Mind the Gap, the way commuters always stand on the right of the escalator \u2014 were woven into the fabric of my day.\nThe financial viability of cities rests on whether and under what conditions we are prepared to go back to our old travel habits. Since the start of the pandemic, urban dwellers have increasingly turned to buses, bicycles and scooters rather than venture back underground. Yet for all of their flaws, subway systems are the economic and social lifeblood of densely populated cities. Vast commercial ecosystems thrive around mass transit stations \u2014 from restaurants and shops to theaters and other small businesses that serve workers and visitors who move through the city. It\u2019s impossible to imagine urban life returning to normal without them.\nNowhere is that more true than in London. Before the pandemic, more than 4 million people a day, or 1 billion a year, used the London Underground, the world\u2019s oldest subway system.\u00a0The Tube has been a symbol of British ingenuity and the Enlightenment value of individual freedom. When it served as a shelter during German air raids in World War II, the Underground became synonymous with English resilience. Harry Beck\u2019s iconic 1931 multi-colored Underground map \u2014 ubiquitous on tea-towels, mouse pads, boxer shorts and most everything else \u2014 is genius not just because it makes getting around London so easy, but because it shaped how Londoners see and experience the city.\nNow an underground system that has defined the life and character of a city since 1863 is edging toward a financial abyss,\u00a0as social distancing and home-working become the new norm. Saving\u00a0the Underground is also caught up in larger political debates over what to prioritize as parts of the economy sink. How those questions are resolved will go a long way toward determining not just London\u2019s economic future, but the shape of post-Brexit society.\n***\nMore than most other subway systems, London\u2019s metro relies heavily on fares to support its operations. Since the start of the lockdown, as\u00a0businesses ordered\u00a0employees to work from home and\u00a0use of the Underground was restricted to essential workers, ridership has plummeted. Transport for London \u2014 the government body responsible for the Tube \u2014 has seen its income drop by 90%.\nTfL\u00a0oversees not just\u00a0the Tube, but London\u2019s vast bus network, its overground train lines, roads, cycle hire scheme and more. It employs some 28,000 workers (and many more indirectly). Just over a month into lockdown, it faced a funding gap for 2020-21 of over 4 billion pounds ($4.41 billion).\nThere is no easy way out of this. The body, which is required by law to have a balanced budget , is limited in how much it can borrow and has already taken on a lot of debt to fund various capital projects. In April, 7,000 workers , a quarter of its workforce, had been furloughed; construction work was frozen.\nIn May, with TfL\u00a0within hours of running out of money, Boris Johnson\u2019s conservative government extended a 1.6 billion pound bailout package, a mix of grants and loans (with the possibility for further funding of up to 1.9 billion pounds). Rescuing the capital city\u2019s iconic mass transit system might seem like a no-brainer for the prime minister, who was a major champion of the Tube when he was London mayor. In those pre-Brexit days, he triumphantly accepted a 1 billion pound loan from the European Investment Bank to fund Crossrail, Europe\u2019s largest infrastructure project and the biggest change to the London Underground schematic since Victorian times.\nBut Johnson won an election on a pledge to rebalance Britain\u2019s economy away from London, which has received the lion\u2019s share of public investment for years. Complicating things further, London mayor Sadiq Khan is a prominent Labour Party figure who has criticized Johnson\u2019s record as mayor.\nTube funding has long been contentious, and the Conservative government was not going to hand anything to London without strings attached, even if the party no longer advocates\u00a0privatization of the network. In exchange for the package, two government officials were put on TfL\u2019s board and key committees. The government also forced Khan to renege on his pledge not to increase fares. In the end, he had no\u00a0choice but to accept, but made clear his bitterness.\u00a0\u201cFailing private rail companies who have let down commuters for years have been bailed out much quicker than TfL,\u201d he said.\nIn its May research update, S&P Global Ratings noted that its base case for global air passengers envisages a full recovery only in 2023. That will have a knock-on effect on leisure travel to London. S&P estimates that TfL\u00a0will see a 50% decline in operating revenue in the fiscal year ending in March 2021, 15% the following year and 10% in 2023. But, of course, these are just guesses; nobody knows how the pandemic will play out. What\u2019s clear is that TfL\u00a0doesn\u2019t have much scope to reduce its expenditure to cover revenue losses. Total debt may rise to two times revenue by 2022.\nTo cover the growing gap, TfL\u00a0will need further subsidies. Indeed, if S&P\u2019s rating on TfL\u00a0is a full two notches higher than its credit profile would warrant, there\u2019s one explicit reason: its strategic importance to London and the health of the U.K. economy.\n***\nThe task of re-imagining the Underground for the Covid era has fallen to TfL\u2019s new chief, Andy Byford, an experienced British-born public transport manager who started his long career with London Underground and returned\u00a0this year after he resigned as head of the New York City Transit Authority, reportedly over interference from Governor Andrew Cuomo .\nByford\u2019s immediate focus has been safety. Shutting down London\u2019s main transport arteries was essential for limiting the transmission of the virus; getting them working again safely is going to be key to the economic recovery. The government\u2019s own Scientific Advisory Group\u00a0for Emergencies (SAGE) noted that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is \u201chighly likely to survive for several hours, and probably several days on typical surfaces within public transport.\u201d The Tube will be an attractive proposition only if commuters like me feel the risks of infection have been contained.\nFollowing the example set in Asia, the London Underground has been getting the mother of all spring cleanings . A new anti-viral cleaning regime uses hospital-grade substances for scrubbing surfaces. TfL\u00a0is experimenting with using UV light to clean handrails on escalators and has installed 1,000 hand sanitizer points. New signage across the network\u00a0reminds people of new rules, such as social distancing, mandatory face coverings and new one-way systems.\nSo far, TfL\u00a0says that tests for the virus at high-frequency touch points have come back negative. It helps that people on subways don\u2019t tend to speak to each other, which would release more aerosols that can spread the disease. The Underground also has a natural ventilation advantage from the piston effect as trains pass through close-fitting tunnels, which create air pressure gradients that push ventilation between platforms. Even so, as SAGE noted, ventilation is not likely to have any impact on short-range transmission (a cough) or surface contact. And it\u2019s not clear how quickly\u00a0a surface can become contaminated again after it has been sanitized.\nWhat is clear is that Covid-19 has created a whole new segment of home-working employees. An estimated 25% of U.K. workers are in jobs where they could work from home some of the time; many likely will.\nSomething not entirely dissimilar happened during the 2012 London Olympics, says Dr Jonathan Reades, a lecturer in quantitative human geography in London and an advisor to TfL\u00a0during that period. Braced for throngs of Olympic spectators, the city worried about dangerous levels of overcrowding on public transport. \u201cThe messaging then was almost exactly the same: Stay at home, shift your working hours. Of course, the reasons were very different,\u201d Reades says.\nReades\u2019s analysis of travel data at the time showed that 10% to 15% of people reduced their travel. Others changed their travel habits, avoiding the most crowded stations and altering their travel times.\nThat experience suggests there are effective ways to redistribute traffic, especially where people have flexibility. And yet daily commuters, the stickiest group of travelers, were least likely to change their habits at the time, he found. Much of that group, myself included, are now working from home with no compelling need to return to daily travel.\n\u201cThe Tube has just passed a phenomenal period of recovery over the past 20 years, through higher levels of investment and management attention to things like reliability. It is now one of the more reliable metros in Europe,\u201d says Alex Barron, head of Metro benchmarking at Imperial College\u2019s Center for Transport Studies. \u201cThis crisis is a real tipping point and could go either way for TfL.\u201d\nWith ridership shrinking, TfL might be tempted to cut\u00a0services. But if the goal is to maximize social distancing and spread Londoners out across different modes and journey rates, reduced services makes little sense. Increasing fares \u2014 another reflexive action \u2014 would also be counterproductive.\nCommuting, particularly by rail and underground, is highly correlated to income in the U.K. With many commuters having the option of working from home, demand will be more elastic than it was and pricing will have to reflect that. Unlike the New York subway, the Tube has six fare zones and charges a higher fare the greater the distance traveled. That structure may need to change too; hiking fares further will only incentivize commuters from further out (who pay the most) to stay away and perhaps encourage employers to locate offices out of central London, where space is cheaper anyhow.\nTfL\u00a0could also use technology to improve traffic flows and commuter confidence \u2014 providing real-time information on crowding, route choice, where to find the most space on a train or other tips. Some proactive messaging was used during the Olympics effectively. Fares might even fluctuate to regulate traffic.\n***\nOne thing\u2019s certain: Bringing Londoners back on the Tube can\u2019t be done on the cheap. Subways require enormous maintenance expenditure. If investment is not made, services decline, customers grow increasingly disgruntled and many will look for alternatives, further damaging revenues. It\u2019s a vicious circle, as New York has learned.\n\u201cBoth Andy Byford and the mayor will be expecting the national government to help in some way. Funding and financing is going to be everything,\u201d says Richard Anderson, managing director of the Transport Strategy Center at Imperial College London.\nDelays and cost overruns on the new Elizabeth line \u2014\u00a0the nearly 18 billion pound Crossrail project \u2014\u00a0also don\u2019t help TfL\u2019s financial picture. In its 2018 business plan, TfL\u00a0figured that delays in construction would cost it up to 600 million pounds in lost revenue by 2024. But that was provided the central section opened in mid-2020; it\u2019s now targeting completion in 2021 and that deadline will likely be missed.\nBoris Johnson sees public sector investment as key to his bid to hold onto the new conservative coalition. Public sector net investment in the U.K. has lagged behind other major economies and infrastructure spending remains\u00a0skewed toward London. This unevenness has social and economic repercussions that have fed into the Brexit vote. It has exacerbated\u00a0divisions between north and south\u00a0and urban and rural areas.\nAdditional financial support for London\u2019s transit system would raise eyebrows in Parliament and\u00a0protest from Johnson\u2019s new voters. The temptation will be to do as little as possible, which worries experts\u00a0like Imperial\u2019s Anderson. \u201cIt would be a mistake for any government to make the decision that in the short term we could squeeze funding. If cities are to thrive, they need sustainable mass transport systems.\u201d\nBut this isn\u2019t just about London.\u00a0However unfashionable among New Tories, London attracts enormous levels of tourism (some of which fans out to the rest of the country), consumer spending and investment that fill\u00a0government coffers and fund\u00a0current spending. It is a world-class center of learning and innovation as well as a center for the arts, fashion and hospitality \u2014\u00a0sectors that need high concentrations of workers and patrons\u00a0and are deeply intertwined with the availability of efficient, safe public transport.\nSome of that creative energy and spending will inevitably shift to areas outside London; that can be to Britain\u2019s benefit, too, with the pandemic assisting the rebalancing agenda. But only to a point. It\u2019s doubtful that Zoom working and small clusterings of workers can replace the well-known agglomeration benefits of cities.\nIt\u2019s just one of many paradoxes this pandemic has thrown up. The longer we stay away, the less there may be to go back to when we ride again.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTherese Raphael is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion.

The New York Times college case tracker ranked the school 14th nationwide in total cases Thursday. That number represents about 7% of Georgia College's total 7,000 enrollment, easily the highest rate of the top 25 schools on that list.\nBy comparison, the Times' tracker ranks infections at the University of Texas in ninth place overall \u2014 but that represents just 483 reported cases out of 50,000 enrolled students. Aside from Texas Christian University, which has about 10,000 students, none of the schools ahead of Georgia College on the Times' list have fewer than 20,000 students or more than 1,000 cases.\nThe workers' action is part of the United Campus Workers of Georgia's (UCWGA) statewide campaign to hold the University System of Georgia Board of Regents responsible for outbreaks due to what a UCWGA press statement calls a \"forced campus reopening.\"\n\"Union members demand choice in online teaching and learning, increased testing capacity, quarantine housing for positive students, hazard pay for all essential workers, and no layoffs in the event of campus closure,\" the statement says.\nA non-tenured faculty and union member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the school is \"acting as if they can't do anything, but there are a number of reasons to believe they could be doing more,\" pointing to in-person regulations.\nThe die-in is in solidarity with Georgia College's sister school, the state flagship University of Georgia, which held one earlier this year.\nThe action, scheduled for two hours from 8 to 10 a.m. will feature students lying on the grass \u2014 socially distanced \u2014 with signs with messages such as, \"We don't want to die\" and \"We don't want our students to die.\"\nGeorgia College President Steve Dorman posted a welcome video last week urging students to practice social distancing. Administrators plan to work with private off-campus apartment complexes to dissuade students from holding large gatherings, which the school holds responsible for most of the surge.\nA tenured faculty member told Salon that the circumstances were \"some dark shit.\"\n\"I think what I fear the most is that they'll get away with it \u2014 with treating faculty, staff and students, not to mention the local community, as utterly expendable. This is some dark shit,\" the professor said. \"You can feel the long arm of the Republican money machine all over it.\"\nFaculty were reportedly told that they could teach remotely only if they could prove one of a dozen or so health conditions on a list \u2014 such as high blood pressure, or being over 65 \u2014 but that did not extend one degree further, for example, to faculty members who may live with someone who is elderly or ill or has underlying conditions.\n\"Many faculty and students here are very, very disturbed by the willful negligence on the part of the USG and our own administration,\" another faculty member told Salon, again on the condition of anonymity.\nWorking groups developed a multi-part reopening plan over the summer, including rules and policies, one of those being that classes must be in-person but office hours and student meetings could be virtual. Though faculty were included in these policy groups, multiple professors told Salon that many concerns were dismissed out of hand, and they did not expect that in-person teaching would continue if case numbers surged as they have.\n\"Most people in these groups, I think, thought that if case numbers went up, they would go to the all-remote plan, to ensure everyone's safety,\" the tenured professor said. \"So here we are, two weeks in. Some people have 50 percent of their class populations in quarantine or isolation.\"\nCampus workers say that the university administration seems to be displacing blame onto students, threatening them with suspension if they attend parties and sending students who fall ill home, with no reserved quarantine locations in place.\n\"I think most faculty find this appalling,\" a professor said. \"Those in the wrong are the people running the show, who brought the students back into what was, in early August, already a precarious environment.\"\nThat environment extends to Milledgeville \u2014 which has itself registered as a coronavirus hotspot , month after month \u2014 a relatively poor city of about 19,000 residents, with the college campus dominating its manicured antebellum downtown.\nThe Milledgeville Union-Recorder reported earlier this month that Navicent Health Baldwin Hospital's intensive care unit has been full since the pandemic hit the city in mid-March.\nTodd Dixon, the hospital's CEO, told the paper that they have experienced about a 3% overall increase in admissions from previous years.\n\"We also have seen a 26 percent increase in our average daily census,\" said Dixon.\nOn the other side of Milledgeville \u2014 which was the capital of Georgia from 1804 to 1868, and was left untouched by Union Army Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's scorched-earth march through Georgia during the Civil War \u2014 sits another campus: The empty, cratered brick dorms of Central State Hospital, which was originally called Georgia Lunatic Asylum and was once the largest mental hospital in the world , with 12,000 inmates.\nCentral State has seen at least 10 coronavirus deaths , according to local news reports, including staff.\nShawn Brooks, vice president for student affairs at Georgia College, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week that no students have reported serious symptoms, a claim faculty say is flatly false.\nOne non-tenured professor told Salon that students had in fact been admitted to the hospital for \"quite serious symptoms \u2014 not one, but multiple,\" but would not provide further details out of fear that it might reveal identifying information to the administration.\nThe school, which has mandated masks on campus, struck a partnership with the state to provide testing at a local health outpost, private providers and two local pharmacies, but results can take up to a week, according to faculty and reports in the Journal-Constitution. There is reportedly no mechanism in place to compel students or employees to report results to the school, so public statistics are derived entirely from self-reported cases.\nBrooks told the Atlanta paper that the spike traced to students who were overexcited and too relaxed after returning to campus in August.\n\"They get off campus and relax their methods of masking and social distancing,\" he said.\nHowever, faculty members told Salon that the school had reneged on its promise that fraternity and sorority rushes, held before classes start, would not occur in person. Furthermore, students weren't required to be tested before arriving.\nThe school did install distanced desks and tables in classrooms as well as plexiglass barriers, and loaded up on hand sanitizer \u2014 though it is still not available in all classrooms.\n\"Rooms are only cleaned once a day, and many of us still don't have hand sanitizer in the classroom,\" a professor said. \"There was none in buildings for first two weeks.\"\n\"It's not easy to take collective action here. As you can imagine, many are afraid to speak up for fear of retaliation,\" the tenured faculty member said. \"But the lack of ethics and of general humanity is stunning. And apparently it's largely about housing revenue.\"\nRolling Stone reported Aug. 11 that it had seen documents that a property-management company called Corvias had pressured the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia not to impose limits on dorm capacity this fall.\nIn response to the letter, Rolling Stone reported, the Board of Regents considered directing at least one school, Georgia State University, to lift its 75% occupancy cap on all dorms controlled by Corvias.\nTo this point, Georgia College has not replied to Salon's request for comment.\nMore Republican groups are gearing up to take Trump down\nFederal judge \"fast-tracks\" census lawsuit against Trump administration\nCalifornia judge orders Uber and Lyft to reclassify drivers as employees\nPostal union officials doubt Louis DeJoy will reverse changes that led to mail slowdown: report"}, {"RECORDID": "20200716-36399", "label": -1, "title": "California Resources seeks bankruptcy protection over oil slump | Reuters", "body": "By Reuters Staff\n2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - California Resources Corp filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday after defaulting on interest payments, becoming the latest U.S. energy company to seek bankruptcy protection in recent months following the slump in oil prices.\nThe oil and gas producer reached an agreement for $1.1 billion debtor-in-possession financing package, which also refinances the company\u2019s current revolving loan facility.\nThe oil driller filed for pre-arranged restructuring in the bankruptcy court in the Southern District of Texas, and listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion.\nCalifornia\u2019s biggest oil and natural gas producer has been weighed down by massive borrowings since its spinoff from Occidental Petroleum in 2014.\n\u201cWe have consistently operated within cash flow, significantly reducing the outsized debt burden we inherited from Occidental ...

Some Republicans have pushed for $450 a week in so-called back-to-work bonuses. Meanwhile, others are pushing to extend the extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits.\nOn Monday, former presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., spoke out in support of creating a universal basic income to help Americans weather the coronavirus pandemic.\nHarris, along with Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Ed Markey, D-Mass., proposed a bill in May that would give $2,000 per month to people making under $120,000, plus $2,000 per child for up to three children.\n\"The government should be here for the people in a moment of crisis,\" Harris said during a Monday webcast hosted by news website The Appeal.\nThe one-time $1,200 checks sent out by the government are not enough, according to Harris.\n\"Can you imagine someone saying, 'You only need to pay rent once ever?'\" Harris said. \"The reality of life is that people have recurring expenses.\"\nA petition with Change.org has gathered 1.2 million signatures supporting the idea. Other proposals in the House have called for sending Americans the same amount of money.\nYet some experts aren't convinced the proposal is the best strategy for helping those in need.\n\"We need a strong federal response,\" said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"But using up a lot of those federal dollars on sending $2,000 a month checks to people who don't really need it would not be an effective use of federal intervention.\"\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives has passed a sweeping $3 trillion bill that would include another round of $1,200 stimulus checks.\nThe terms of the payments would be similar to the first round. That includes payments of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 per married couple.\nBut children would get $1,200 apiece, up from $500 in the first round, up to a maximum of three children.\nThat means families would stand to get as much as $6,000.\nTo be eligible, you would have to meet certain income thresholds, based on either your 2018 or 2019 tax return. Individuals who make up to $75,000 would get full payments, which would be reduced for income above that amount and eliminated altogether at $99,000. Married couples who file jointly would get full checks at up to $150,000 in income. Those who earn above $198,000 would not be eligible.\nThe proposal is a starting point for negotiations with the Republican-led Senate, and could be subject to change.\nThe problem with the checks is that they don't necessarily target those who most need them, said Chuck Marr,\u00a0director of federal tax policy at the\u00a0Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\"What's most important is that top priority be given to the people who are harmed,\" Marr said.\nThe House Democrats' proposal, if passed, would also extend the extra $600 per week in federal unemployment benefits through the end of January 2021.\nCurrently, that extra money is set to stop in late July.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the next coronavirus stimulus bill will not extend those benefits.\nHowever, experts argue that money would target the people who need financial help the most.\n\"The case for much, much more generous unemployment insurance at a time when jobs are going to be super-scarce is really strong,\" said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. \"It's just incredibly well targeted .\"\nWe will likely need extended unemployment benefits for 12 months or more, Bivens said.\nOne proposal from Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, seeks to give Americans who return to work a $450 weekly bonus.\nThe money would be in addition to the salary they are earning.\nThe incentive would make it more lucrative to return to work. A recent study from the University of Chicago and American Action Forum found that 60% to 70% of people on unemployment are making more than they did at their regular jobs, because of enhanced federal benefits.\n\"The point is to have a bonus to go back to work, which helps everybody, helps the worker, helps the small business and helps the taxpayer,\" Portman said in an interview with CNBC.\nSuch a strategy would not fully replace unemployment benefits, which millions of families in need are relying on, Akabas said.

Brown Convention Center. The Texas GOP promptly sued and eventually petitioned to the state\u2019s Supreme Court, asking the court to order the enforcement of the contract that was signed. The GOP lost that bid on Monday.\nThe Texas Supreme Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus , which would have directed Houston First Corporation to perform legal obligations under the contract. The court cited a lack of jurisdiction in a narrow ruling.\nAs the court noted, Houston First, when terminating the convention agreement last week, \u201cinvoked a force majeure clause\u201d (sometimes referred to as an \u201cact of God\u201d clause)\u2014citing \u201cthe unprecedented scope and severity of the COVID-19 epidemic in Houston.\u201d The 2020 State Convention had been scheduled to take place from July 13-20. The Texas GOP claimed that Houston First had a \u201cduty imposed by law\u201d to carry out the terms of the agreement, even during a pandemic:\nThe Party invokes Section 273.061 of the Election Code, which gives the Court jurisdiction to \u201cissue a writ of mandamus to compel the performance of any duty imposed by law in connection with the holding of an election or a political party convention, regardless of whether the person responsible for performing the duty is a public officer.\u201d TEX. ELEC. CODE \u00a7 273.061 (emphasis added).\nThe court concluded that the statute the Texas GOP cited in its mandamus petition was \u201cinapplicable.\u201d\n\u201cSection 1.005(10) defines \u2018law\u2019 in the Election Code to mean \u2018a constitution, statute, city charter, or city ordinance.\u2019 Id. \u00a7 1.005(10). Thus, \u2018duty imposed by law\u2019 in Section 273.061 is limited to a duty imposed by a constitution, statute, city charter, or city ordinance,\u201d the Texas Supreme Court ruled. \u201cThe Party does not assert that Houston First owes it any such duty. The Party argues it has constitutional rights to hold a convention and engage in electoral activities, and that is unquestionably true. But those rights do not allow it to simply commandeer use of the Center. Houston First\u2019s only duty to allow the Party use of the Center for its Convention is under the terms of the parties\u2019 Agreement, not a constitution.\u201d\nJustice John P. Devine dissented.\n\u201cIn sum, I would not allow Houston First to put its contractual obligations second. Exercising our mandamus jurisdiction here to compel Houston First and the other defendants to host the Republican Party\u2019s convention is not only appropriate\u2014but necessary\u2014to preserve the sanctity of contract and our elections,\u201d Devine said. \u201cToday the Court errs by refusing to uphold these values. And this refusal, I\u2019m afraid, will have ripple effects far beyond this misguided jurisdictional punt.

Take a sore throat\u2014you might be tempted to shrug off this symptom, but even as one of the less commonly known ones (the most prevalent are fever , dry cough , tiredness , and shortness of breath ), it may still indicate infection.\nIn fact, the World Health Organization notes that 13.9 percent of COVID-19 patients have presented with sore throats.\n\u201cSome patients that have experienced sore throat during COVID-19 have reported that it feels like a super dry throat,\u201d says Leo Nissola, M.D ., a scientist and investigator at the COVID-19 National Convalescence Plasma Project as well as advisor at COVIDActNow. \u201cAnd the medical reports show redness in the throat, without bacterial infection, like strep, for example.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a tricky question.\nThere are numerous causes for inflammation of the inner lining of the throat, including allergies, upper respiratory infections (both viral and bacterial), acid reflux, and even throat cancer.\n\n\n\nNot to mention this: \u201cThere is still so much we don't know about COVID-19 and what we do know has been evolving over time,\u201d says Inna Husain, M.D ., an assistant professor in otolaryngology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\u201cAt this time, all upper respiratory illnesses are COVID-19 until proven otherwise.\u201d What's more, an April review in the European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology revealed that ear, nose, and throat symptoms may precede the development of severe cases of COVID-19.\nVideo: Fauci says new swine flu strain will be monitored but it is not 'an immediate threat' (NBC News)\n5 ways to keep your quarantine workout routine going as you head back to work\nHear from nurse who shared shocking weight loss photos\nA look at the potential long term effects of Covid-19\nWearing surgical mask may reduce COVID-19 infections up to 75%\nSneeze guards are trending right now.

More specifically, you'll feel pain when swallowing that can be achy, sharp, or even create a burning sensation.\nA sore throat may also be accompanied by a runny nose, nasal congestion, cough, or fever. Other symptoms, according to Alexandra Kreps, M.D., an internist at Tru Whole Care, include \u201cchanges in your voice, swollen lymph nodes in your neck or jaw area, and when looking at your tonsils in a mirror they may be red and irritated or could have white patches or pus if severely infected.\u201d\nHowever, Dr. Nissola, says \u201cit is more likely to be a COVID-related sore throat if there are more symptoms, such as fever and malaise.\u201d\nA good rule of thumb: \u201cIf your sore throat is also accompanied with fever or cough, be suspicious. If your sore throat comes after an episode of heartburn likely its related to reflux. If it is accompanied by sino-nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing, it may be allergies,\u201d says Dr. Husain.\nHow you treat your sore throat symptoms should really consider the root cause.\nGenerally, though, Dr. Husain recommends hydration (drinking water or tea), steam inhalation, and lozenges containing lubricants such as honey. Pain relievers such as Tylenol can also help with discomfort.\nAdds Dr. Lerner: If sore throat is from excessive coughing, you can address it though cough suppressants. For nasal congestion, which causes mouth breathing and dryness, try humidification or hydration through nasal saline or irrigation. \u201cPatients that have COVID-19, should be cautious of nasal spread and do this in a safe way, so as not to expose others to aerosols and droplets that may occur from these types of treatments,\u201d he says.\nIf sore throat is due to allergies, on the other hand, pretreatment with antihistamine prior to allergy season or known allergen exposure\u2014 in other wards take an allergy pill\u2014 can be helpful, says Dr. Husain.\nLast, if the sore throat is caused by reflux, following an anti-reflux diet may lead to a favorable outcome. \u201cI would encourage people to eliminate anything heavily acidic or citrus as this can irritate the lining of the throat.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted in May that there will still be 10 million fewer people employed at the end of 2021 than there were at the beginning of this year.\nDespite the overall drop in joblessness, the unemployment rate for African Americans rose to 16.8% from 16.7% in April.\nThe news comes amid mass protests across the country spurred by the death of George Floyd, an African-American man, in police custody in Minneapolis last week.\nTrump said Floyd might be pleased by the jobs report.\n\u201cHopefully, George is looking down right now, and saying, \u2018This is a great thing that\u2019s happening for our country,\u2019\u201d he said.\nThat drew a rebuke from former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who noted that Floyd\u2019s last words were \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as a police officer kneeled on his neck.\n\u201cFor the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd, I frankly, think is despicable,\u201d Biden said at an event in Delaware.\nA raft of recent public polls showed Trump trailing Biden nationally and in some of the battleground states where the Nov. 3 election will be decided.\nTrump has struggled to respond to the novel coronavirus, which led to nationwide lockdowns that put the economy into a virtual standstill. More than 1.88 million Americans have been infected and more than 108,000 have been killed here by the virus since February.\nTrump, who was criticized for initially downplaying the threat of the virus to the United States, said authorities should focus on protecting the elderly, who are more likely to die from the virus, and allow younger people to return to work and school. He said states like California that still have restrictions in place should follow the example of Florida and other states that have lifted them.\nThe U.S. Congress has signed off on trillions of dollars in economic aid but is now deadlocked over whether additional stimulus is needed.\nDemocrats said Washington needed to do more to head off public-sector layoffs. \u201cNow is not the time to be complacent or take a victory lap,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\nTrump said he would support further relief and Vice President Mike Pence, in an interview with CNBC, said that could include aid to states that have warned they may have to lay off teachers, police and other public employees.

Other studies, including one from the Yale School of Public Health , have reached similar conclusions but with markedly fewer patients and specimens.\nResearchers also found that specimens self-collected from the front of the nose are less effective than deep nasal swabs for virus detection. This finding prompted a subsequent study that has not yet been published in which researchers learned they could improve the sensitivity of anterior nasal swab testing to 98% by combining an anterior nasal swab with a swab collected from the back of the throat.\nThe results have important implications for patients and providers. The collection process for saliva and anterior nasal specimens is less invasive than the deep nasal, or nasopharyngeal, swab. In addition, both specimen types can be self-collected, reducing the risk of exposure for healthcare workers who collect nasopharyngeal specimens, said Kimberly Hanson , MD, MPH, section chief of clinical microbiology at ARUP and the primary author of the study.\n\"Saliva and nasal swab self-collection can resolve many of the resource and safety issues involved in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing,\" Delgado said.\nARUP and U of U Health anticipate being able to start offering testing on saliva in some U of U Health clinical settings in early September. They already are using anterior nasal swabs in combination with throat swabs to test some asymptomatic individuals.\nCOVID-19 testing on these alternatives to nasopharyngeal swabs will increase with time, Delgado said. \"From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, ARUP has worked to build capacity for high-quality COVID-19 testing,\" he said. \"Our goal is to make this testing available to hospitals and healthcare systems nationwide.\"\nHanson and her colleagues analyzed more than 1,100 specimens from 368 volunteers at the U of U Health Redwood Health Center drive-through testing site from late May through June. Volunteers self-collected saliva that they spit into a tube and swabbed from the front of both nostrils to produce specimens for testing. The researchers compared test results from these specimen types with test results from nasopharyngeal swabs healthcare providers collected from the volunteers. Discrepant results across specimens collected from the same patient triggered repeat testing using a second polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based platform.\nThe study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in at least two specimen types in 90% of the patients who tested positive for the virus.\nAs a standalone alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva proved to be an excellent option, Hanson said. Positivity rates for saliva specimens were nearly the same as those for nasopharyngeal specimens.\nThe research showed that self-collected nasal swabs, when used alone, can miss nearly 15% of infections, which prompted researchers' further study combining them with oropharyngeal, or throat swabs.\nThe research is an example of how ARUP and U of U Health continue to explore new methods to serve patients and the community as well as keep healthcare workers safe, said Richard Orlandi , MD, chief medical officer for ambulatory health at U of U Health. \"We appreciate the researchers at ARUP, as well as the staff and patients at our Redwood testing center who have participated in this discovery,\" he said. \"This exciting advance reflects ARUP's and U of U Health's innovative spirit and the benefits of our partnership.\"\nAbout ARUP Laboratories Founded in 1984, ARUP Laboratories is a leading national reference laboratory and a nonprofit enterprise of the University of Utah and its Department of Pathology.

I don\u2019t say this proudly. At the time, it wasn\u2019t rational. It was a drain on my mental health and bank account.\nBut I couldn\u2019t help it: I was a committed germaphobe.\nThis phase lasted most of my adult life. Finally, a couple of years ago, after a lot of work and cognitive behavioral therapy, I got over my germaphobia. I was free! What a relief!\nAnd then the punchline: Along came COVID-19, and my germaphobia has come roaring back. My only solace is that, thanks to my years of microbial obsession, I have developed a better, wiser, more evidence-based version of germaphobia. Or so I tell myself.\nTo back up: I began my social distancing soon after college. When people stuck their hands out for a shake, I demurred, offering instead the now ubiquitous elbow bump. Or else I\u2019d try to convince them to do a touch-free \u201cair handshake,\u201d which looks like two people having simultaneous tremors.\nI boasted many other germaphobe bona fides. I washed my hands surgeon-style until they were raw. I didn\u2019t clink wine glasses during a toast, unless it was the bottom of the glass, where the microbes were less likely to lurk. Before I allowed my kids to sit in the swings in Central Park, I slathered them with hand sanitizers, much to my wife\u2019s dismay.\nI got to be adept at balancing myself while standing on the subway\u2014my version of surfing\u2014since I couldn\u2019t imagine allowing my skin to contact a subway pole.\nI was so vocal about my fear of\u2014actually, disgust with\u2014microbes, the New York  Post ran an article in 2000 about germaphobia, featuring photos of two prototypical germ haters: me and Donald Trump. (More on him later).\nI\u2019m not sure the origin of my germaphobia. My inborn OCD probably plays a part. I also did get colds and the flu with alarming ease, my immune system as welcoming as a Marriott, so I felt it smart to be extra vigilant.\nI was also a huge consumer of germ porn, which couldn\u2019t have helped. Perhaps you\u2019re familiar with the genre: news segments that warn you that there are more germs on your remote control than on your toilet seat, your sponge is a hot zone, your cell phone should be quarantined. Cue footage of unwashed hands under black light, all Jackson Pollocked with glowing purple germ splotches.\nThat kind of thing.\nI love the elaborate metaphors they use to convey the unimaginable number of germs. You have more germs in your gut right now than humans that ever lived on earth! (This is true.)\nI contributed to the genre, in a way. I\u2019m an author, and I worked my germ obsession into my books. For one book, I followed the rules of the Bible as strictly as possible. Because the Old Testament discourages touching women who are menstruating, I\u2019d tell women I couldn\u2019t shake their hands in case they were menstruating. This received mixed reactions. I also refused to shake men\u2019s hands during my biblical year. The Bible says that men are unclean for a day after their \u201cemission of seed.\u201d So the possibility of a recent ejaculation gave me a good excuse not to touch male palms.\nMy wife hated the menstruation laws in particular, and my germaphobia in general.\nHated the smell of Purell\u2014a romance-killer, she called it. She sided with the medical professionals (and there were many) who said my behavior could actually backfire.\nThey\u2019ve named their theory the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that children in modern first-world countries aren\u2019t exposed to enough germs, which throws off the development of the immune system. Our immune cells don\u2019t get the chance to learn to recognize and assassinate the bad guys, thus our overly-sanitized world could paradoxically be responsible for the dramatic rise in allergies and asthma.\nWhen one of our sons was a toddler, we bought him an ice cream cone on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. As he was walking out of the shop, his scoop fell on the sidewalk. Amazingly, he didn\u2019t get upset. Instead, he got down on all fours and started licking it off the pavement. A woman walking behind him gasped, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d But my wife? She had no problem with it. New York is one big dinner plate.\nOver the past few years, I slowly migrated toward my wife\u2019s way of seeing things. Germs took up less space in my brain. I became much more relaxed. I started shaking hands, even touching subway poles.\nThere were several reasons for my conversion.\nFirst, I think the hygiene hypothesis has some validity.\nSecond, I felt my germaphobia was playing into the stereotype of a neurotic Jew. It\u2019s a trope in pop culture\u2014your Larry David, your Howie Mandell. I didn\u2019t want to feed into that.\nThird, I read a lot of rationalist literature about long-term threats, such as nuclear war, climate change, and artificial intelligence gone awry. I figured, if I\u2019m going to worry about something, maybe those things are actually worth my anxiety, rather than catching a cold from a hotel sink.\nPlus, I read some very convincing defenses of germs. Turns out they suffer from bad PR. Our bodies are hosts to billions of germs, and many perform crucial life-saving functions. Only a small percentage are bad.\nAnd finally, there was the Trump Factor.\nI disagree with our president on almost every imaginable topic. It bothered me that we shared this one obsession with germs. Since very few of his positions seem based on evidence or rational thought, I figured maybe germaphobia was in the same bucket.\nIt inspired my re-examination of the topic.\nI even found some evidence\u2014and it\u2019s admittedly far from proven\u2014that germaphobia is linked to a heightened sense of purity, which can manifest itself in other unpleasant ways, such as fear of the other and fear of foreigners (Here\u2019s a link to a New York Times op-ed by two scientists who argue that the more obsessed you are with germs, the more politically conservative you become. Again, I\u2019m not totally convinced, but it\u2019s an interesting theory).\nSo I committed myself to overcoming germaphobia. And I did.\nCut to last week, and the biggest epidemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu. America shut down. We all became Howard Hughes, but with better reason.\nIn fact, if you are not a germaphobe now, you are irresponsible and endangering lives. (Oddly, Trump, the longtime germaphobe, seemed to get over his germaphobia. He repeatedly downplayed the COVID-19 threat, probably in an attempt to protect the economy).\nSo now I\u2019m back to washing my hands incessantly, not touching poles, opening doors with my elbows or a scarf-wrapped hand.\nBut maybe I\u2019m also a bit wiser, having wrestled with this topic for decades.\nStrangely, even though the stakes are higher, I feel my germaphobia is less anxiety-producing. It\u2019s a calmer, more rational, more evidence-based avoidance of germs. I do all the best practices, but without that sense of disgust I used to have. Disgust is a draining emotion. I\u2019m not a fan. I see it as a vestige of paleolithic times, and is dangerous and unreliable guide to morality.\nI now try to take disgust out of the equation. I try not to fear or hate germs. Because stressing about germs is probably counterproductive. Constant worry makes our immune systems more vulnerable.\nSo instead of ruminating all day about those little microscopic bastards with the ferocity of a recently spurned lover, I just avoid the hell out of them.\nYou Might Also Like\nHOW TO FIND THE PERFECT SUNGLASSES FOR YOUR FACE SHAPE\nIf You Don\u2019t Have a Denim Shirt Yet, What\u2019s Stopping You?\nWhy You'll Never Understand Mezcal Like You Understand Scotch"}, {"RECORDID": "20200501-35128", "label": -1, "title": "Wall Street tumbles as renewed tariff threat adds to uncertainties | Reuters", "body": "By Stephen Culp\n4 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street sold off sharply on Friday after President Donald Trump revived a threat of new tariffs against China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought global economies to a grinding halt.\nAll three major U.S. stock averages closed down well over 2%, and for the week they all lost ground.\nMay is often marked by sell-offs, and on the month\u2019s first day, with jitters on the rise as some U.S. states begin easing coronavirus shutdowns, the adage held true.\n\u201cMarkets had a very strong April as they looked through the valley of economic weakness to a point when stimulus will reignite economic growth,\u201d said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. \u201cBut it could be a longer and deeper valley than many hoped.\u201d\nIndeed, stocks had a remarkable run in April, with the S&P 500 and the Dow both posting their strongest monthly percentage gains in 33 years.\nTrump said his administration was crafting retaliatory measures against China as punishment for the coronavirus outbreak, once again sparking tariff fears that rattled markets through much of the last two years.

They are also quickly countering scientific studies on tyres and microplastic pollution with ones of their own that say tyre particles present no significant risk to humans and the environment.\nCardno ChemRisk, a U.S.-based consultancy that has worked with companies facing chemical exposure litigation, including Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N , BP Plc BP.L and Ford Motor Co F.N ., is spearheading the tyre industry's response to the microplastics threat. It declined to comment for this story.\nThe plastic particles, which are increasingly being found in the air, food, drinking water and even Arctic ice, may pose a risk to human health and marine life, although there is no scientific consensus on the issue. The World Health Organization said last year that there was an urgent need to find out more about the health impact of microplastics, which some environmental researchers say could weaken the immune system.\nAt least 10 studies since 2014 by academics and environmental consultancies cite particles generated by friction between tyres and the road as one of the biggest sources of microplastics - fragments less than five millimetres long \u2013 being released into the environment.\nThe tyre industry has published at least ten studies over the last decade concluding that tyre particles present no significant risk to humans and the environment, and are not as prevalent as other research shows.\nThe reports, available online, were all fully or partly authored by Cardno ChemRisk, according to a Reuters review of the documents. Three of the reports have been published since 2017.\nOn its website, the consultancy says its work \u201cis not influenced by the member companies of the (tyre) industry, nor by the trade associations\u201d.\nThe Tire Industry Project (TIP) \u2013 which is funded by 11 tyre companies, including Bridgestone Corp 5108.T , The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.O , The Michelin Group MICO.PA and Continental AG CONG.DE - commissioned most of those assessments, according to the group's website.\nThe European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association (ETRMA), an industry body lobbying European lawmakers, also commissioned a study authored by Cardno ChemRisk consultants.\nTwo former Cardno ChemRisk employees who prepared some of the reports and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the assessments were partly aimed at preparing for potential chemical exposure claims that could be brought by individuals, companies or governments. It was not possible to independently confirm this.\n\u201cWe focus on issues where we think there is a lot of litigation potential,\u201d one of the former employees said. \u201cIf we found something that would make our client look bad, we wouldn\u2019t publish it.\u201d\nGavin Whitmore, a TIP spokesman, said the group\u2019s sponsored research was aimed at \u201canswering fundamental questions about the potential human health and environmental impacts of tyres\u201d and not as preparation for possible chemical exposure claims. He added that the group had no knowledge of Cardno ChemRisk omitting information from its studies.\nChemRisk worked with BP after the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, Pacific Gas & Electric in the water contamination lawsuit in the 1990s that inspired the movie Erin Brockovich, and for Johnson & Johnson and Ford in asbestos cases. It was bought by Cardno, an Australian infrastructure group, in 2012.\nETRMA and TIP said the research they commissioned from Cardno ChemRisk was independent and fair.\nFor tyre makers facing new rules, the stakes are high. EU lawmakers are considering regulations that would set minimum standards for tyre design to reduce microplastic pollution, such as the rate of abrasion and durability.\nThe requirement could lead to billions of dollars in redesign costs for tyre makers, three industry sources said.\nJarmo Sunnari, senior manager on standards and regulation at Nokian Tyres Oyj TYRES.HE , a Finnish manufacturer, said the effect would be of \"that kind of great magnitude\", when asked about estimates of a financial hit of billions of dollars made by several industry experts.\nSuch added costs would be a financial headache for an industry that has suffered a sharp drop in sales due to the coronavirus outbreak, ETRMA data last week showed.\nFazilet Cinaralp, ETRMA\u2019s secretary general, acknowledged a cost from future regulations but that it was too early to quantify. She said ETRMA\u2019s goal was to broaden knowledge about tyre wear by funding research and assisting with the development of a tyre wear test.\n\u201cThe tyre industry wants to be part of the solution,\u201d said Cinaralp.\nOlly Jamieson, a researcher for Eunomia, a sustainability consultancy that conducted a 2018 study on tyre wear for the European Commission, said the industry tended to focus on external factors influencing tyre wear like driver behaviour, road conditions and weather, rather than things like tyre design, cited in the scientific studies.\nEnvironmental groups have also questioned the independence and accuracy of the industry studies. Specifically, they take issue with the narrow use of consultants and the industry\u2019s conclusion that there is no risk to health from tyre particles.\n\u201cGiven evidence of the contribution to both air pollution and aquatic pollution, it is misleading to claim that there is no risk of harm from tyre-wear microplastic emissions,\u201d said Julian Kirby, plastics pollution campaigner for Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that has studied the links between tyres and plastic pollution in Britain.\n\u201cThere is an appreciable risk that pollution from car tyres is harmful to human health.\u201d\nThe tyre companies and company-funded groups say it is premature to declare that particles from tyres are harmful to humans or the environment.\n\u201cThe peer-reviewed scientific research that we have sponsored concludes that\u201d tyre and road-wear particles \u201cpresent low risk to human health and the environment,\u201d TIP\u2019s Whitmore said.\n\u201cThe scientific data that we have do not show a risk on human health or any demonstrative impact on flora and fauna,\u201d said Cyrille Roget, Michelin\u2019s technical and scientific communication director.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to continue to work on the gaps that we have in our knowledge.\u201d\nJoerg Burfien, who was until recently head of global standards and regulations at Continental, said microplastics had become a focus for the firm in the last two years.\n\u201cWe are open to solve it but we also said let\u2019s look at all facts, let\u2019s not have an emotional debate,\u201d said Burfien, who was named president of Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., a Continental subsidiary, in January.\nEunomia\u2019s 2018 study concluded that 500,000 tonnes of microplastics are generated from tyres in the EU every year, accounting for potentially the largest source of microplastics in the aquatic environment.\nA year earlier, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) published a paper that estimated that tyres were responsible for 28% of primary microplastics in the world\u2019s oceans.\nWeeks later, ETRMA, the tyre-lobbying body, commissioned a study that found that most tyre particles never make it into rivers and oceans as they are captured in drains or by the roadside.\nETRMA says it could be take up to seven years to roll out a test for tyre abrasion, which will impact the timeframe for future legislation. Some critics say this is a delaying tactic. Cinaralp said the ETRMA was not trying to delay EU legislation.\n\u201cI do not see any great commitment by the tyre industry to address this problem,\u201d said Joao de Sousa, a marine plastics specialist at IUCN who has held consultations on microplastics with tyre industry officials. \u201cThey want business as usual.\u201d\n(Corrects spelling of Joerg Burfien\u2019s name in paras 30 and 31)\nReporting by Joe Brock and John Geddie in Singapore; Editing by Philip McClellan\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200905-23146", "label": -1, "title": "First Toilet Paper, Then Yeast. Now Laptops are Hard to Find in US", "body": "In March, as the United States transitioned to online learning almost overnight because of the pandemic, many schools and families did their best to make do with the tools they had.\nThe situation revealed deep disparities in access to at-home technology, and many school districts hoped to rectify the situation when they began hybrid or online schooling come fall.\n\"When we found out we would be doing remote learning in full, it meant we had to get devices distributed out to students in need,\" Lara Hussain, manager of academic technology for Denver Public Schools, told CNN Business. \"Timing was critical ... No one wants to start where students have no access to devices or the internet.\"\nBut with districts across the country all placing big device orders around the same time \u2014 and with many universities and companies also reliant on remote work \u2014 the unprecedented demand for laptops has strained supply chains. As a result, schools and families are dealing with shipping delays, limited selections and higher-than-usual technology costs.\nMany device makers say they're working to scale production to meet the need, but there's only so much they can do. \"The supply chain is not built to satisfy this kind of demand,\" NPD analyst Stephen Baker said, adding: \"I would be surprised if anything is fully caught up before the end of the [calendar] year.\"\n'Not even a fraction of what we needed'\nDenver Public Schools began the process of ordering devices in April for the fall, and by mid-July had completed orders for more than 12,500 Lenovo 300E touchscreen laptops, Hussain said. The district had previously used that device and believed it had the features and durability needed for remote learning.\nBut several weeks later, the district's third-party supplier said the order was stuck in US Customs, and encouraged DPS to look into alternatives.\n\"We worked on a myriad of fronts to look at other solutions,\" Hussain said. \"We started calling big box stores, Amazon, to see what was the max amount that we could order over any number of days. What we saw very quickly was that there was no inventory, not even a fraction of what we needed.\"\nBest Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Barry said on an earnings call last week that \"stronger-than-anticipated demand\" as the company reopened stores \"resulted in more constrained product availability.\" Amazon (AMZN) declined to comment, but its website also shows limited stock for some devices.\nSo the Denver school district dug through school storage units and refurbished old laptops, and asked families that borrowed devices in the spring to return them if they had other options. It also bought other laptops for nearly $100,000 more than what it had originally planned to pay.\nThe issue has implications beyond the added stress and money. Hussain said that having students on different kinds of laptops complicates repair processes and forces teachers to troubleshoot across multiple operating systems.\n\"From an academic standpoint, we want our teachers to be familiar with the tools that students will be working on,\" Hussain said. \"If we're all familiar with a common device, that results in better outcomes for our students and reduces lost instruction time.\"\nOther school districts have also run into the issue, with varying degrees of severity.\nA spokesperson for Los Angeles Unified School District told CNN Business last week that devices are currently available for all of its students, but outstanding orders for replacement Chromebooks and iPads have been delayed.\nAnd in Waterford, Michigan, Vicki Shellnut said her kids' school district has also experienced delays in receiving its laptop order. She's been juggling her three childrens' schedules on a single district-issued device.\nWhile her 14-year-old son has two hours of online class daily, Shellnut's 10- and 9-year-old spend just a half hour checking in with their teachers and use paper packets sent by the school for most of their work \u2014 which Shellnut then has to grade. \u2003 Balancing all that with online homework programs and telehealth doctors' appointments has made for a tricky scheduling task. But buying another device isn't an option for Shellnut's family after her husband, who works in sales, was temporarily out of work because of the pandemic.\n\"I have kids with different sign-ins and programs and I have to try to to make sure that they get their time in every day,\" Shellnut said. \"It's going to be challenging with all the scheduling trying to make sure everything is done.\"\n'Sales spikes that we haven't ever seen'\nThe issue is not that device makers are producing fewer laptops. Many device makers are actually enjoying elevated sales. Since the first week of April, PC retail sales have jumped 44% compared to the same period in the prior year, according to NPD's Baker.\nThis year, though, demand this year has been so great that tech companies have been left scrambling to meet the need.\n\"Acer and the entire industry are facing historic demand for computers and monitors,\" a spokesperson for device maker Acer said in a statement to CNN Business. \"Component supply is fairly tight; however, Acer and our supplies are working diligently to put products in the hands of customers as quickly as possible.\"\nSimilarly, an HP (HPQ) spokesperson said: \"We are working hard to help schools get computers in the hands of students as quickly as possible.\"\nThe rapid increase in demand compounded existing pressure on many tech companies' supply chains. Even before the coronavirus hit, device makers were already grappling with tariffs and other Trump administration restrictions on trade with China. And in the early days of the pandemic, many producers in China temporarily shut down factories or scaled back operations.\n\"When [laptop] sales started increasing in March, no one started out in a good place,\" NPD analyst Stephen Baker said.\nStill, he added, if things had normalized after several weeks, tech suppliers would likely have caught up. \"But the fact that it's gone on for five months means that it's a challenge,\" he said.\nIn a recent earnings call, Dell (DELL) Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke pointed out that it can take a while to get crucial laptop components, such as silicon and liquid crystal display screens.\n\"The lead times in our products service are getting better by the day,\" Clarke said. \"But that's the challenge in front of us ... It's this unanticipated spike in demand in this particular sub-segment that has driven industry shortages, which I'm sure you heard from everybody, we're responding to.\""}, {"RECORDID": "20200726-30614", "label": -1, "title": "Millions of Indonesian migrant workers face hardship in Malaysia amid coronavirus fallout", "body": "While Malaysia managed to flatten its COVID-19 curve with a strict stay-at-home order, a slowed economy has seen many migrant workers from neighbouring Indonesia struggle to feed themselves.\nCoronavirus entered Malaysia early in the pandemic and for a time , the country had the largest caseload in South-East Asia.\nBut it brought strict lockdown arrangements into place on March 18, known locally as the movement control order , which has seen cases limited to 8,861 \u2014 about one third less than Australia's \u2014 with just 123 deaths.\nClaims that foreigners were not observing social distancing, however, saw\u00a0 in raids widely condemned by rights groups.\nMalaysia's Human Rights Commission last month warned of the \"proliferation of hate speech and racial stereotyping \u2026\u00a0as well as targeting refugees and migrant workers in social media attacks and petitions calling for their repatriation.\"\nFor many of Malaysia's undocumented migrants, life was hard even before the pandemic hit.\nAs Indonesians \u2014 particularly women \u2014 face an increasingly desperate situation, there are growing calls for Jakarta to do more to help people unable to return home and facing discrimination.\nWhile Indonesians officially number around 1 million in Malaysia, the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur and the NGO Migrant Care both estimate there are more like 2.5 to 3 million people living there.\nUndocumented women are often employed as domestic workers \u2014 making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse \u2014 while many men work in construction.\nAlex Ong, a spokesperson for Migrant Care, told the ABC that even though strict lockdown measures had been eased, \"many migrant workers still cannot work\".\n\"Children, those who are sick and the elderly are the most vulnerable.\"\nSuswati suffers from leukemia. She had been working for a door-to-door cleaning service but is now unable to work and is stuck at home, financially supported by her husband, who is undocumented.\nKarmadi, another migrant worker who is assisting Suswati, told the ABC she is reluctant to seek treatment due to the high fees charged by the hospital.\nFor treatment, she would be charged 12,000 Malaysian ringgit ($3,950), Karmadi said. The minimum wage in Kuala Lumpur is 1,200 ringgit per month, and migrant workers are often underpaid, especially if they are undocumented.\nBut Karmadi said Suswati is too weak to travel, having lost 30 kilograms since becoming ill.\n\"At the moment, if she were to return, she would not be able to stand the pain on the plane because her body is weak,\" he said.\n\"We hope there are people who can help with treatment at the hospital.\"\nAs unemployment has increased due to lockdown and a decline in economic activity, Malaysia's legions of migrant workers have been hit hardest.\nUnable to access government assistance, many have turned to the charity of organisations such as Migrant Care for essentials like food and medicine.\nWhen the movement control order was implemented in March, Indonesian MP Christina Aryani called for immediate food aid to be provided by Indonesia.\n\"Many of our migrant workers in Malaysia are construction workers, factory workers, waitresses or janitors. They are paid daily or weekly,\" she said, as quoted by the Jakarta Post.\n\"We have urged the Government to send them staple food via the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\"\nAccording to Mr Ong, however: \"The Indonesian Embassy is not so\u00a0responsive\u00a0to the hardships of Indonesian citizens who are facing a crisis\".\n\"Many have lost their jobs. Food aid has been stopped. Many companies have closed down and have not fulfilled their previous salary obligations,\" he said.\nLyn Dani, an Indonesian national who teaches the children of migrant workers in Malaysia, told the ABC that a number of her students' parents who were undocumented had not been paid since the movement control order came into place.\n\"For workers who are Malaysian citizens, there is a certain amount of ration assistance in the form of rice, flour, sugar and cooking oil. This assistance does not apply to migrant workers,\" she said.\nAgung Cahaya Sumirat, the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur's counsellor for social and cultural affairs, told the ABC that they had assisted Indonesian migrants \u2014 both documented and undocumented.\nThe consulate had covered hospital costs for those who were sick and accommodated women in need of protection in shelters, he said, as well as assisting in mediation with agents and employers.\nIt had also distributed some 140,000 meal packs for families on several occasions during the movement control order.\nBut Karmadi said that when he had reached out to the Indonesian Embassy for assistance, they had simply \"asked a lot of questions\" but did not have the budget to assist citizens in need.\n\"It's easier to deal with NGOs like Migrant Care than the Indonesian Embassy. Without [Migrant Care], things would be very hard.\"\nKarmadi said for the duration of the two-month lockdown, he had not been able to work and was forced to skip meals.\n\"I just stayed hungry, so I'd have enough for rent at my boarding house,\" he said.\nDozens of Indonesians die in Malaysia each year. According to Migrant Care, 62 people from Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province alone were killed in Malaysia in 2017 .\nLabour rights abuses against migrant workers in Malaysia are widely documented. The ABC this week reported that rubber gloves made by Malaysia's largest producer were potentially linked to modern slavery.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, meanwhile, has seen rights groups and the UN express concern over growing xenophobia against migrants and refugees in Malaysia.\nPublic frustration has particularly been directed at the country's population of some 100,000 Rohingya asylum seekers and refugees , many of whom have lived in Malaysia for generations without the right to work legally.\n\"Using a pandemic to persecute vulnerable communities is a violation of their right to liberty.

It could be months before there are enough laptops\u2014particularly Chromebooks which many school districts favor because they are cheap\u2014to fulfill demand.\nPut simply, this could put many students who weren\u2019t already able to get a Chromebook or another laptop to use for remote learning at an extreme disadvantage: Academically falling behind their peers because they are unable to access lessons and class materials. This particularly affects at-risk students, like youth in foster care . More than 80% of students in foster care do not own a computer and typically rely on their school, family, friends, or non-profits like John Burton Advocates for Youth (JBAY), Human I-T, and TechSoup for access to one. Those non-profits are also feeling the laptop shortage, which means they can\u2019t supply as many students with one as they would like.\nAdditionally, some school districts are more hesitant to loan laptops to at-risk students because of the systemic belief that they are more likely to damage or lose that laptop\u2014which also disproportionately affects Black and Latinx students further.\nA 2018 U.S. Census report showed 12.7 million households lacked a desktop or laptop computer in 2016, and noted that \u201chouseholds with a Black householder were the least likely to own or use a desktop or laptop, own or use a tablet, or to have a broadband subscription.\u201d Addressing this shortage isn\u2019t going to happen before the fall semester starts, unfortunately\u2014and that\u2019s on top of students who don\u2019t already have reliable internet access.\nWhat this means is that as companies struggle to get enough supply to meet the increased demand the already striking education gap in this country will continue to grow."}, {"RECORDID": "20200416-61865", "label": -1, "title": "Spain considers summer school for quarantined children, coronavirus deaths rise | Reuters", "body": "By Clara-Laeila Laudette , Emma Pinedo\n4 Min Read\nMADRID (Reuters) - Spain reported another substantial increase in daily deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday, taking the overall toll to more than 19,000, but figures from the region of Catalonia suggest the true total could be several thousand higher.\nThe health ministry said 551 people died in the 24 hours to Thursday, up from 523 on Wednesday, bringing the total to 19,130.\nThe overall number of those infected rose to 182,816 from 177,633 on Wednesday, an increase that health emergency chief Fernando Simon said was largely due to increased testing.

It is the second-oldest team currently on the circuit and trails only Ferrari in total number of wins. McLaren won 12 drivers' titles -- including with racing legends Alain Prost and the late Ayrton Senna -- and the Constructors' Championship on eight occasions. But the group's racing division has struggled in recent years. Its two current drivers -- Spaniard Carlos Sainz Jr. and British-Belgian Lando Norris -- have no victories and just one podium finish between them. McLaren is now lobbying Formula 1 to introduce a budget cap next year that could reduce the gap between less well-funded teams and runaway leaders such as Mercedes and Ferrari. The Formula 1 season has been suspended and is not eyeing a return until July. Orders for McLaren's supercars have also fallen steeply. Walsh said the group has invested in developing \"a new lightweight, hybrid vehicle architecture\" that will enter serial production at the end of the year. Most car manufacturers have had to dramatically scale back production because global lockdowns reduced their available work force. Car sales in Italy imploded by 98 percent in April -- a month in which almost all of the Mediterranean country's factories were shut. Sky News reported that McLaren intended to raise \ufffd275 million ($340 million / 310 million euros) \"against the value of its classic car collection\" and its headquarters building in the southern English city of Surrey.

The royal swapped her usual heels for a pair of comfortable trainers, and appeared relaxed as she stepped out in the autumnal sun to meet with fellow parents.\nThe duchess chatted with parents helped by different peer groups - such as Home-Start, National Childbirth Trust (NCT) and Mush - and heard how they had struggled to meet up during the Covid-19 lockdown,\u00a0but kept up their work on zoom and regular phone calls.\nHome-Start volunteers give thousands of hours of help to parents tackling issues such as postnatal depression, isolation and bereavement.\nSingle-mothers Irma Martus, 47, and Carol Elliott, 41, told the duchess how they had been helped out with weekly check-up phone calls from volunteer Home-Start Wandsworth during the pandemic.\nA survey revealed two-thirds of mothers are not confident they can get the right mental health support and many were unable to speak to GPs or their family during the pandemic.\nKate said: 'Does it help emotionally too? You feel less judged? Everybody needs to have those friendships' Adding: 'It must be difficult to meet up socially distancing.'\nAfterwards Irma, who was referred to Home-Start after her 22-month-old son Emmanuel was diagnosed with Down's syndrome, said: 'She said she was passionate about support for single mothers through peer support.'\nCarol said: 'I said my volunteer calls me every week and they feel like a proper friend and she said everyone needs friends.'\nThe duchess also met mothers Nalini Sadai and Jessie Brett who provide peer to peer mother support for the National Childbirth Trust.

The data, however, excludes gig workers and others collecting benefits under a federal government program.\nThese workers do not qualify for the regular state unemployment insurance. The various programs, different reporting periods and protocols at state unemployment offices make it hard to get a clear pulse on the labor market.\nEconomists said the government\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, which offered businesses loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries, was also creating confusion.\n\u201cWe are entering the confusion stage for the employment and unemployment numbers,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. \u201cReopening of the economy is taking people from government payrolls to private sector payrolls, which is good. But the PPP is creating problems with understanding what exactly is happening.\u201d\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 323,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.123 million for the week ended May 23, the Labor Department said. Claims have declined steadily since hitting a record 6.867 million in late March, but have not registered below 2 million since mid-March.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast initial claims falling to 2.1 million in the latest week. Layoffs persist in the insurance, educational services, public administration, transportation and warehousing, agriculture, construction, manufacturing and retail trade industries.\nThe astonishingly high level of claims, nearly three months after the shuttering of non-essential businesses to control the spread of COVID-19, points to a long recovery for the economy.\nThat was underscored by other data from the Commerce Department on Thursday showing business spending on equipment plummeting in April and the economy contracting at a much steeper 5.0% annualized rate in the first quarter instead of the previously estimated 4.8% pace.\nData in hand, including on the housing market, manufacturing and consumer spending has left economists expecting gross domestic product could drop in the second quarter at as much as a 40% rate, the worst since the Great Depression.\nStocks on Wall Street were trading higher, but simmering tensions between the United States and China kept investors on edge. The dollar eased against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices dipped.\nA record 40.767 million people filed claims since March 21.\n\u201cWe think these filings in the 10 weeks since the mid-March coronavirus pandemic lockdown tells the true story of the wreckage out there in the country and the enormous long-term damage done to the economy,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.\nThe number of people still receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 3.860 million to 21.052 million in the week ending May 16. The so-called continuing claims number is reported with a week lag.\nEconomists cautioned against reading too much into the sharp decline, noting that some states required residents to file for benefits on a bi-weekly basis, which they said was injecting volatility into the data. The drop in continuing claims was concentrated in Florida, California, Washington State and Ohio.\n\u201cWe doubt this is due to hiring and may reflect more the fact the continuing claims numbers are state benefits and don\u2019t include the people claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.\nThe Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program is the federal government initiative that pays unemployment checks to gig workers and many others for coronavirus-related job and income losses.\nThese workers do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance and are not included in both the weekly jobless claims and continuing claims figures. There were 1.193 million claims submitted last week under the PUA program, on top of the 7.793 million applications processed in the week ending May 9.\nIncluding gig workers and other claimants, a staggering 31 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in early May.\nThe continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for May\u2019s unemployment rate.\nContinuing claims increased roughly by 3 million between the April and May survey periods, suggesting a rise in the jobless rate from a post-World War Two record of 14.7% last month.\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200409-97097", "label": 1, "title": "Pass the salt: The minute details that helped Germany build virus defences | Reuters", "body": "By J\u00f6rn Poltz , Paul Carrel\n9 Min Read\nMUNICH (Reuters) - One January lunchtime in a car parts company, a worker turned to a colleague and asked to borrow the salt.\nAs well as the saltshaker, in that instant, they shared the new coronavirus, scientists have since concluded.\nThat their exchange was documented at all is the result of intense scrutiny, part of a rare success story in the global fight against the virus.\nThe co-workers were early links in what was to be the first documented chain of multiple human-to-human transmissions outside Asia of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\nThey are based in Stockdorf, a German town of 4,000 near Munich in Bavaria, and they work at car parts supplier Webasto Group. The company was thrust under a global microscope after it disclosed that one of its employees, a Chinese woman, caught the virus and brought it to Webasto headquarters. There, it was passed to colleagues - including, scientists would learn, a person lunching in the canteen with whom the Chinese patient had no contact.\nThe Jan. 22 canteen scene was one of dozens of mundane incidents that scientists have logged in a medical manhunt to trace, test and isolate infected workers so that the regional government of Bavaria could stop the virus from spreading.\nThat hunt has helped Germany win crucial time to build its COVID-19 defences.\nThe time Germany bought may have saved lives, scientists say. Its first outbreak of locally transmitted COVID-19 began earlier than Italy\u2019s, but Germany has had many fewer deaths. Italy\u2019s first detected local transmission was on Feb. 21. By then Germany had kicked off a health ministry information campaign and a government strategy to tackle the virus which would hinge on widespread testing. In Germany so far, more than 2,100 people have died of COVID-19. In Italy, with a smaller population, the total exceeds 17,600.\n\u201cWe learned that we must meticulously trace chains of infection in order to interrupt them,\u201d Clemens Wendtner, the doctor who treated the Munich patients, told Reuters.\nWendtner teamed up with some of Germany\u2019s top scientists to tackle what became known as the \u2018Munich cluster,\u2019 and they advised the Bavarian government on how to respond. Bavaria led the way with the lockdowns, which went nationwide on March 22.\nScientists including England\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty have credited Germany\u2019s early, widespread testing with slowing the spread of the virus. \u201c\u2018We all know Germany got ahead in terms of its ability to do testing for the virus and there\u2019s a lot to learn from that,\u2019\u201d he said on TV earlier this week.\nChristian Drosten, the top virologist at Berlin\u2019s Charite hospital, said Germany was helped by having a clear early cluster. \u201cBecause we had this Munich cohort right at the start ... it became clear that with a big push we could inhibit this spreading further,\u201d he said in a daily podcast for NDR radio on the coronavirus.\nDrosten, who declined to be interviewed for this story, was one of more than 40 scientists involved in scrutiny of the cluster. Their work was documented in preliminary form in a working paper at the end of last month. The paper, not yet peer-reviewed, was shared on the NDR site.\nIt was on Monday, Jan. 27, that Holger Engelmann, Webasto\u2019s CEO, told the authorities that one of his employees had tested positive for the new coronavirus. The woman, who was based in Shanghai, had facilitated several days of workshops and attended meetings at Webasto\u2019s HQ.\nThe woman\u2019s parents, from Wuhan, had visited her before she travelled on Jan. 19 to Stockdorf, the paper said. While in Germany, she felt unusual chest and back aches and was tired for her whole stay. But she put the symptoms down to jet lag.\nShe became feverish on the return flight to China, tested positive after landing and was hospitalised. Her parents also later tested positive. She told her managers of the result and they emailed the CEO.\nIn Germany, Engelmann said he immediately set up a crisis team that alerted the medical authorities and started trying to trace staff members who had been in contact with their Chinese colleague.\nThe CEO himself was among them. \u201cJust four or five days before I received the news, I had shaken hands with her,\u201d he said.\nNow known as Germany\u2019s \u201cCase #0,\u201d the Shanghai patient is a \u201clong-standing, proven employee from project management\u201d who Engelmann knows personally, he told Reuters. The company has not revealed her identity or that of others involved, saying anonymity has encouraged staff to co-operate in Germany\u2019s effort to contain the virus.\nThe task of finding who had contact with her was made easier by Webasto workers\u2019 electronic calendars \u2013 for the most part, all the doctors needed was to look at staff appointments.\n\u201cIt was a stroke of luck,\u201d said Wendtner, the doctor who treated the Munich patients. \u201cWe got all the information we needed from the staff to reconstruct the chains of infection.\u201d\nFor example, case #1 - the first person in Germany to be infected by the Chinese woman - sat next to her in a meeting in a small room on Jan. 20, the scientists wrote.\nWhere calendar data was incomplete, the scientists said, they were often able to use whole genome sequencing, which analyses differences in the genetic code of the virus from different patients, to map its spread.\nBy following all these links, they discovered that case #4 had been in contact several times with the Shanghai patient. Then case #4 sat back-to-back with a colleague in the canteen.\nWhen that colleague turned to borrow the salt, the scientists deduced, the virus passed between them. The colleague became case #5.\nWebasto said on Jan. 28 it was temporarily closing its Stockdorf site. Between Jan. 27 and Feb. 11, a total of 16 COVID-19 cases were identified in the Munich cluster. All but one were to develop symptoms.\nAll those who tested positive were sent to hospital so they could be observed and doctors could learn from the disease.\nBavaria closed down public life in mid-March. Germany has since closed schools, shops, restaurants, playgrounds and sports facilities, and many companies have shut to aid the cause.\nThis is not to say Germany has defeated COVID-19.\nIts coronavirus death rate of 1.9%, based on data collated by Reuters, is the lowest among the countries most affected and compares with 12.6% in Italy. But experts say more deaths in Germany are inevitable.\n\u201cThe death rate will rise,\u201d said Lothar Wieler, president of Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.\nThe difference between Germany and Italy is partly statistical: Germany\u2019s rate seems so much lower because it has tested widely. Germany has carried out more than 1.3 million tests, according to the Robert Koch Institute. It is now carrying out up to 500,000 tests a week, Drosten said. Italy has conducted more than 807,000 tests since Feb. 21, according to its Civil Protection Agency. With a few local exceptions, Italy only tests people taken to hospital with clear and severe symptoms.\nGermany\u2019s government is using the weeks gained by the Munich experience to double the number of intensive care beds from about 28,000. The country already has Europe\u2019s highest number of critical care beds per head of the population, according to a 2012 study.\nEven that may not be enough, however. An Interior Ministry paper sent to other government departments on March 22 included a worst-case scenario with more than 1 million deaths.\nAnother scenario saw 12,000 deaths - with more testing after partial relaxation of restrictions. That scenario was dubbed \u201chammer and dance,\u201d a term coined by blogger Tomas Pueyo. It refers to the \u2018hammer\u2019 of quick aggressive measures for some weeks, including heavy social distancing, followed by the \u2018dance\u2019 of calibrating such measures depending on the transmission rate.\nThe German government paper argued that in the \u2018hammer and dance\u2019 scenario, the use of big data and location tracking is inevitable. Such monitoring is already proving controversial in Germany, where memories of the East German Stasi secret police and its informants are still fresh in the minds of many.\nA subsequent draft action plan compiled by the government proposes the rapid tracing of infection chains, mandatory mask-wearing in public and limits on gatherings to help enable a phased return to normal life after Germany\u2019s lockdown. The government is backing the development of a smartphone app to help trace infections.\nGermany has said it will re-evaluate the lockdown after the Easter holiday; for the car parts maker at the heart of its first outbreak, the immediate crisis is over. Webasto\u2019s office has reopened.\nAll 16 people who caught COVID-19 there have recovered.\nJoern Poltz reported from Munich, Paul Carrel from Berlin; Additional reporting by Markus Wacket in Berlin and Gavin Jones in Rome; Edited by Sara Ledwith\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200204-74078", "label": -1, "title": "Photos: Coronavirus outbreak", "body": "China has been battling an outbreak of a new SARS-like coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, with the city of Wuhan as the epicenter.

They would not require that middle seats be left empty on planes, a measure some airlines say would make profitable flying impossible.\nThe Brussels-based Commission also wants vouchers for cancelled flights or holidays to be valid for at least a year, with protection against bankruptcies, so people would accept them instead of demanding refunds from cash-strapped airlines and travel firms.\nIt said people should be able to stay in hotels, eat in restaurants or go to beaches - though it stressed the situation would have to be monitored to prevent a new surge in infections.\n\"This looks like good news,\" said Toni Mayor, president of a hotels' association in Spain's Valencia region which includes the major package holiday destination Benidorm. \"If this combines with less pressure from the virus, as it seems, ... we might just be able to half-save the summer season.\"\nEuropean governments are pressing ahead with their own plans to reopen at different speeds, depending on national circumstances, and some are promoting domestic tourism.\nAlready, the three Baltic states have decided to reopen borders to each others' citizens from May 15, creating a \"travel bubble\".\nAustria and Germany plan to fully reopen their border on June 15. That will particularly help Austria's tourism industry, which relies heavily on German visitors.\nAnd Switzerland plans to completely reopen borders to all neighbours except Italy on June 15, provided the pandemic allows.\nHowever, Italy warned against border pacts between individual EU nations, saying such deals could destroy the single market.\n\"We will not accept bilateral accords within the European Union that might create privileged tourist channels,\" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in Rome. \"That would leave us outside the European Union and we will never allow this.\"\nGERMAN TRAVEL AGENTS PROTEST\nSome of the biggest tourist destinations are in the hardest-hit countries, like Italy, Spain and France, which are only opening up slowly.\nSpanish authorities are planning to keep the country's borders closed to most travellers from abroad until July, two foreign ministry sources said on Wednesday.\nSome countries are also planning to impose two-week quarantine periods for travellers arriving from abroad - including Britain, which has left the EU but is observing its trade and travel regulations until the end of the year while it negotiates its future relations with the bloc.\nWithin Europe's \"Schengen\" area, where borders are normally invisible, at least 17 nations have imposed emergency border controls.\nWith more than 6 million jobs in the tourism sector at risk across Europe, German travel agents protested on Wednesday to demand more government support for the industry.\nIn Berlin, some drove buses past the Brandenburg Gate, emblazoned with banners.

Here's how to spot them", "body": "By the time the urgent text message warning that the U.S. military was about to deploy soldiers across the country to enforce a nationwide quarantine landed on Pamela Chelin's phone this week, it had already made its way to an untold number of people.\nA friend had sent her the foreboding note, which claimed to be from someone who spoke to \"a source that works for Homeland Security.\" The friend, in turn, had received it from another friend, who he considered \"reliable.\"\n\"Who knows,\" Chelin's friend wrote, \"but I believe them, given who sent it to me.\"\nChelin, a freelance arts journalist in Los Angeles, thought otherwise. The message's jumbled syntax and anonymous claims made her suspicious. After a quick check of Twitter confirmed it was fake, she told her friend and another acquaintance who sent her a similar message not to spread the hoaxes any further.\n\"There was just enough to it that you could see how someone would say, 'I don't want to believe this, but maybe it could be true and I don't want to be the one who ignored it,'\" Chelin said Tuesday. \"It's a bit ominous that someone purposefully created this to create panic.\"\nThe message and several others like it that have circulated widely over the past week created a potent rumor mill and stirred up fear among recipients with dire warnings of martial law being imminently imposed by President Trump and similarly extreme scenarios, in which soldiers would be ordered to keep people in their homes.\nThe fake missives spread to enough people that government officials felt they needed to knock them down with statements assuring the public they were untrue.\n\"There is no national lockdown,\" the White House's National Security Council tweeted on Sunday, telling people to consult the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website for accurate information.\nThe messages were the latest examples of the misinformation that has spread via social media, emails and text messages as the coronavirus has moved into all 50 states in the U.S.\nThe prevalence of hoax missives and less nefarious but nonetheless inaccurate information led the World Health Organization\u2019s director last month to declare that disinformation was as dangerous as the virus itself.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Feb. 15.\nSome of the text messages, along with similar posts on Twitter and other social media platforms, compounded the confusion and worry by equating the idea of a government order instructing people to remain in their homes with martial law.\nThe two concepts are very different, said Michelle M. Mello, a health law scholar at Stanford Law School.\nMartial law refers to a rarely used and legally contentious power written into the Constitution under which the military is given authority to enforce civil laws throughout the country or a particular area during times of emergency when local courts and law enforcement are unable to do so. During a period of martial law, the due process rights typically given to criminal defendants and other basic rights can be suspended.\nPresident Abraham Lincoln famously put the country under martial law during the Civil War. The declaration applied to prisoners of war, spies, other Confederate sympathizers and Union deserters, and ultimately the Supreme Court ruled Lincoln's proclamation had been unconstitutional in parts of the country where civil courts were still functioning.\nSimilarly, a federal judge sharply criticized how the U.S. Army carried out martial law in Hawaii in the years following the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nBy contrast, the power to order people to remain in their homes during a health emergency, ban large gatherings and force restaurants to close, stems from state emergency public health laws that give officials broad authority to take aggressive steps aimed at protecting lives, Mello said.\nThese laws, which go into effect when a state or local official declares a public health emergency, boost the authority officials have during normal times to safeguard the public by, for example, forcing a contagious person to be isolated, Mello said. Police and judges, not the military, are responsible for enforcing the newly imposed restrictions.\n\"Our public health laws attempt to balance people's civil rights with the government's need to prepare and react to situations. In emergencies, that balance shifts slightly toward the government,\" Mello said.\nThe emergency laws also free up special funds and allow state and local officials to put aside strict regulations hospitals and health professionals must typically work under. Hospitals, for example, have been given greater flexibility on the types of facilities that can be used to treat patients and retired doctors without current licenses can be called on to work.\nThe text messages Chelin received were full of official-sounding and plausible claims.\nOne purported to contain firsthand information detailing how members of the military had been told to prepare for as long as a month on U.S. streets \u201cto help prevent looters and rioters\u201d during a nationwide quarantine.\nThe rambling message also claimed that \u201chigh ranking military friends in DC\u201d had alerted the author of the president\u2019s plan to invoke a special federal law, the Stafford Act, to authorize his quarantine order.\nTrump did, in fact, use the Stafford Act last week when he declared a national emergency, but the move had nothing to do with quarantining people. Instead, the act allows states to more easily seek emergency assistance from the federal government.\nAnd, as officials around California and elsewhere in the country began to issue dramatic orders that seemed to resemble the measures outlined in the messages, the hoaxes took on a greater sheen of believability.\nFor example, several counties that are home to millions of people imposed shelter-in-place orders making it it a crime for residents to leave their homes except for specific reasons, such as grocery shopping or getting medications from a pharmacy. (Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had initially held back, deferring to county and city leaders, ultimately followed suit with a statewide edict Thursday.)\nCourts also scaled back and delayed operations considerably.\nAnd Defense Secretary Mark Esper told a news conference Tuesday that more than 1,500 members of the National Guard had been activated in 18 states to staff drive-through testing facilities and emergency operations centers, as well as to sanitize public areas and transport healthcare workers.\n\u201cPeople should be reassured rather than threatened by these orders,\u201d Mello said Tuesday. \u201cThey show California\u2019s leaders are doing what needs to be done to stop this virus.\u201d"}, {"RECORDID": "20200319-63776", "label": -1, "title": "California issues 'stay home' order; U.S. death toll hits 200 | Reuters", "body": "By Dan Whitcomb , David Shepardson\n6 Min Read\nLOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - California issued an unprecedented statewide \u201cstay at home\u201d order on Thursday for its 40 million residents and Washington warned Americans to return home or stay abroad indefinitely, as the number of coronavirus deaths in the country hit 200.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom\u2019s directive, effective immediately, marks the largest and most sweeping government clampdown yet in the worsening public health crisis brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak, which he predicted could infect more than half the state within eight weeks.\nAs authorities ramped up measures to keep the virus from spreading, Washington could announce restrictions on travel across the U.S.-Mexico border as soon as Friday, limiting crossings to essential travel, two officials briefed on the matter said.

These include , but are not limited to, Agnostura bitters, Bacardi-Martini, Bollinger champagne, GH Mumm champagne, Krug champagne and Johnnie Walker Scotch.\nBut what is the Queen's favourite drink of choice? And how frequently is she known to drink?\nDarren McGrady, who previously worked as a personal chef for Queen Elizabeth II for over a decade, and later served Princess Diana and her two sons, William and Harry, recently divulged everything that the Queen eats in a day .\nSharing a series of videos on YouTube, the former royal chef explained that during his time working for the monarch between 1982 and 1993, the Queen enjoyed four small meals a day, and always took afternoon tea - even when they were on the Royal Yacht Britannia on a tour of Australia.\nWhen it comes to Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s favourite tipple, the nonagenarian is (like the Queen Mother also was) partial to a gin and Dubonnet \u2013 a sweet, wine-based aperitif \u2013 McGrady told CNN in August 2017.\nWhen McGrady spoke to the publication three years ago, he clarified reports that had quoted him as saying that the Queen consumed four drinks a day.\nHe explained that he had been speaking over the phone when he said the Queen has a \u201cgin and Dubonnet\u201d, not a \u201cgin in the morning\u201d, as he was mistakenly reported as stating.\n\u201cShe\u2019d be pickled if she drank that much,\u201d he said, stating that the Queen \u201cdoesn\u2019t wake up in the morning and have a large gin and tonic\u201d.\n\u201cAll I said was she likes a gin and Dubonnet. That\u2019s her favourite drink,\u201d he added.\nTo make the Queen\u2019s favourite beverage the monarch is served two parts Dubonnet with one part gin.\nIn addition to her gin and Dubonnet combo, the Queen also occasionally enjoys a sweet, German wine with her dinner.\n\u201cJust in the evening,\u201d McGrady said. \u201cShe certainly doesn\u2019t drink four glasses a day.\u201d\nIn July, it was announced that Buckingham Palace had released an own-brand gin , made from ingredients taken from the gardens of the Queen\u2019s London residence.\nThe spirit consists of ingredients including hawthorn berries, lemon verbena, mulberry leaves and bay leaves.\nInfused with citrus and herbal notes, the gin costs \u00a340 for a 70cl bottle and is 42 per cent ABV.\nShortly after the gin was released by the Royal Collection Trust, it was reported that it had sold out online within eight hours .\nA spokesperson for the Trust said the organisation was \u201cdelighted with the response\u201d to the gin, stating that another order had been placed with the supplier."}, {"RECORDID": "20200806-91301", "label": 0, "title": "How to start home schooling during COVID-19: Requirements, curriculum and tips", "body": "Back-to-school season is upon us, and districts in many states have unveiled\u00a0plans for trying to safely reopen schools this fall amid coronavirus spikes . While some studies suggest that younger children are less susceptible to COVID-19 , it's still possible that they could infect teachers or relatives. That fear is leading many parents to explore home schooling for the first time.\nAbout 3% of US students were home-schooled in the 2011-12 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics . But a poll taken in May of more than 2,100 parents found that 40% said they were more likely to home-school or virtual school after lockdowns. And states are reporting increases as well. Home school filings with the Nebraska Department of Education are up 21% over this time last year. So many North Carolina parents accessed the state portal for registering new home schools the first day it was open this month that it crashed.\nRead more: Best back-to-school gear under $100 for 2020 \nThe nonprofit Home School Legal Defense Association has seen inquiries about home schooling increase at least 20% over the same time last year, said spokesperson Sandra Kim.\n\"States are now releasing what they're going to do for the fall, and I think many parents have decided that they're not happy about what is being offered,\" Kim said.\nHome schooling is not the same as public school moving online , as many did in March due to the pandemic. Home schooling means that you've turned in a notice of intent to your child's school district, which states that you're no longer a part of the public school system and are taking charge of your child's education on your own.\nEven parents who work full time can find ways to home-school, said Brian D. Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute. That might mean connecting with local support groups and cooperatives, or getting a relative involved to help.\nWhether you've already decided to home-school your child this academic year or if you're still exploring your options, here are the six tips for getting started with home schooling.\nRead more:  The best 5 affordable Chromebooks for back-to-school or distance learning \nHome schooling is legal in all 50 states. However, every state has different home schooling laws and requirements, which you can find on your state department of education's website. You can also find a list of laws by state on the site A2Z Homeschooling . These might include hours, subjects and testing.\nYou'll find both national and local groups on Facebook -- just search for \"home schooling\" and your town or county. If you already know someone in your area who home-schools, ask them for help, too. Many areas have home school pods or co-ops where you can pair up with other families for lessons. This might look different due ot COVID-19, but may still exist in some form -- perhaps outdoor, socially distanced classes.\nFinding a home school community in your area can help you with just about everything -- navigating curriculum options, setting up a schedule and just figuring out what you're doing. It also potentially gives you the opportunity to share the teaching burden with others, and give your kids some social time.\nDecide where your home school space will be -- ideally, somewhere where everyone can sit comfortably and concentrate. This might mean using the kitchen table, or putting desks in the basement, Kim said.\nOne of the perks of home schooling is that your schedule can be far more flexible than in a traditional school. If your kids are early risers, start the day earlier. Depending on their learning style, you may also be able to move more quickly through some lessons and free up time for afternoon activities, like visiting a park.\nRead more: Our favorite back to school picks for 2020 \nSearching for lessons online can be overwhelming -- there are hundreds of options available . You can find boxes that provide books and curriculum materials for a whole year of a given subject, or fully online programs. What you choose should depend on your child's learning style, and what you feel comfortable with as a parent teacher.\nMany people take a hybrid approach, Kim said: A parent might teach reading and writing, and have their child take a math course online, along with \"electives\" like coding or a language.\nWhatever blend you choose, you don't have to spend much money on curriculum. On average, parents spend around $600 per year per child for materials. But there's a very wide range: Some spend under $100, and others spend thousands, Ray said. You can definitely get by for relatively little cost: A lot of home school groups sell or trade used curriculum boxes, so you might get something that originally cost a couple of thousand dollars for just a couple of hundred.\nYou can find free or low-cost online courses on sites like Khan Academy , Varsity Tutors and Outschool .\nLet's make tea with the Cuzen Matcha\nStarlink space-based internet, explained\nApple cuts prices on some battery replacements, Spotify hit with huge lawsuit\nHow to have the ultimate, electrified road trip\nHow to add a voice assistant to your car\nHome schooling offers you a great opportunity to take advantage of the world around you, Ray said. Say you notice a bird's nest built in your backyard -- you can throw out the science lesson you were planning for that day and instead pull out the Field Guide to North American Birds and pivot to learning about that together.\nThis might seem strange at first, but remember, \"you do not need to recreate an institutional school in your home,\" Ray said. \"If you do, you're going to miss out on many of the benefits of home-based education.\"\nKeep your expectations in check, Kim said: Your child probably won't master a new language or move up two levels of math in their first year of home schooling. Reading, writing and math are still the most important areas to focus on, she added. Plus, there will be a learning curve for both parents becoming comfortable as teachers, and kids getting used to their parents as teachers.\n\"Next year is going to be very strange for everyone, whatever you choose to do,\" Kim said.\nFor more on coronavirus and education, check out these free or low-cost K-12 online classes and activities , classes to learn to code and how to help parents and students navigate education during COVID-19 .\nLet's make tea with the Cuzen Matcha\nStarlink space-based internet, explained\nApple cuts prices on some battery replacements, Spotify hit with huge lawsuit\nHow to have the ultimate, electrified road trip\nHow to add a voice assistant to your car\nVideo: How and when to teach your children financial literacy (CBS News)\nWhat's next?

Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) solutions are expected to make a significant contribution while responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing ever-changing challenges. The current situation as a result of the outbreak of the epidemic will encourage pharmaceutical suppliers and healthcare establishments to enhance their R&D investment in AI, acting as a key technology for enabling various initiatives. The insurance industry is expected to face the pressure associated with cost-efficiency. Using AI will help reduce operating costs and, at the same time, increase customer satisfaction during the renewal process, claims, and other services. VR/AR will assist in e-learning, which would boost competition due to the closure of many schools and universities.

Mountain Health Network has furloughed the majority of their 6,000 employees at hospitals throughout West Virginia. The Cookeville Regional Medical Center in Tennessee sent home 400 staff members last week and will cut hours of other employees. The Medical University of South Carolina laid off 900 workers and Ohio's largest health system has temporarily laid off 700 nonmedical workers.\nHospitals across Oklahoma have followed the national trend of canceling all elective surgeries, hoping to be ready in case COVID-19 cases spike in their region. And while it's essential to be prepared for what may come, it's also putting a massive dent in the hospitals bottom line.\n\"Let's be clear, elective surgeries are the lifeblood of many hospitals, if not all hospitals,\" said Mary Dale Peterson, president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"They account for 50 to 60% of profits for most.\"\nMORE: Doctors, nurses from across the US step up to help NYC on the coronavirus front lines\nHillcrest Medical System CEO Kevin Gross said surgeries are down 75% systemwide, which creates a massive revenue problem, resulting in layoffs as the hospital \"seeks to balance our resources against the economic impact we are seeing.\"\nMeanwhile hospitals in New York and New Jersey are scrambling to hire health care workers as the coronavirus overwhelms their ER wards -- offering nurses as much as $6,000 a week for their services. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has pleaded for doctors and nurses to come to the city to help. The Department of Veterans Affairs is struggling to find additional health care workers for its government-run hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area and Chicago.\nBut some medical professionals feel they are being discouraged from going where they're needed most.\nColby Pacheco currently works as a contract nurse at an Oklahoma hospital, but feels his role might be on the chopping block if furloughs continue. He's considering an out-of-state move temporarily to aid overwhelmed health care colleagues in hotspot zones. The idea hasn't been well received in his community.\n\"I've had Facebook friends post that we're cowards, sellouts and leaving Oklahoma vulnerable for when COVID-19 hits,\" Pacheco said. \"When you explain there is no work here, people say we need to buckle down and it's our civic duty to stay.\"\nAbove all, Pacheco hopes hospitals and the general public don't lose sight of what's most important: saving lives.\n\"It's a weird position to be in as a nurse, not knowing if you'll have a job during a pandemic,\" Pacheco said. \"I just hope big business doesn't get in the way of nurses doing their jobs and helping people.\"\nHealth care workers fear losing their jobs during coronavirus pandemic originally appeared on abcnews.go.com"}, {"RECORDID": "20200630-68738", "label": 1, "title": "Adoption agencies inundated with \u2018surprisingly high\u2019 volume of inquiries during lockdown", "body": "Adoption agencies have experienced a \"surprisingly high\" number of inquiries from prospective parents in lockdown , an adoption charity has said.\nSpeaking to Press Association, Dr Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of Adoption UK , said that the pandemic has prompted an unexpected number of people considering adopting a child.\nDr Armstrong Brown explained that she thinks the number of inquiries is due to people having more time in lockdown to \u201cthink about what they really want in life\u201d.\n\u201cWe are observing that inquiry levels from prospective adopters looking to start the process have remained quite buoyant, which is very encouraging and not necessarily what was expected,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe interpretation of that is this lockdown has given people some breathing space to assess their lives and consider what they want to do \u2013 a bit of thinking time.\u201d\nVideo: 'We'll put laws in place... if necessary' (Sky News)\nTaiwan politicians scuffle over US pork imports\n'Certainly possible' tiers could change pre-Xmas\nThousands mourn as Maradona buried\nTrump: I'll 'certainly' leave if Biden is winner\nTens of thousands line streets for Maradona's coffin\nHighlights: Race And Revolution - Will Britain Change?\nBLM supporter who went viral 'doesn't see colour'\nMaradona mourners clash with riot police\n'I wouldn't advise' hugging elderly relatives at Xmas\n'How are you going to test 40% of England?'\nLineker: Maradona was 'good-natured guy'\nShilton: 'Maradona won World Cup on his own'\nBurnham's fears for business support\n'Heartbroken' hotel owner on Tier 3\nAstronaut shares his first video of Earth\n'Significant number of areas' in Tier 3\nRoughly 3,000 children are adopted in England each year, but due to the coronavirus outbreak, many couples in the midst of adopting have been unable to complete the process due to social distancing and lockdown rules.\nDr Armstrong Brown went on to discuss how delays in the adoption process can negatively impact the children involved.\n\u201cThat would have been very confusing and difficult to understand,\u201d she added.\n\u201cRight now we are right up against it and it\u2019s not always obvious what the consequences of the pandemic will be.\n\u201cI suspect we are going to see more people in trouble, because of job losses.\n\u201cBut also I think more people will be coming forward to adopt because they have had the time to think about what they really want in life and decided adopting is interesting to them.\u201d\nShe added that she was \u201csurprised\u201d by the level of interest in adoption but also \u201cvery encouraged\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic sign of people\u2019s optimism and resilience that they are \u2013 in such uncertain times \u2013 being able to think about taking such a major step.\u201d"}, {"RECORDID": "20200828-63385", "label": 1, "title": "New York's Museum of Modern Art re-opens with few visitors", "body": "New York's Museum of Modern Art reopened its doors Thursday following a nearly six-month shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, allowing visitors the rare experience of viewing its works by Monet, Van Gogh and Warhol without the usual throngs of visitors.\nMOMA is the first major museum in the Big Apple to reopen to the public since the US cultural capital was hard-hit by the virus, bringing its busy calendar to a halt.\nUnder the new regulations, and with the tourism sector at a standstill due to the pandemic, only a few art lovers reserved a time slot for the church-like calm of reopening day.\nCrowds won't grow much bigger, as the museum will operate at 25 percent of capacity and with the now-usual precautions of social distancing and temperature checks.\n\"I like galleries not being too crowded and people not talking and people not taking pictures.

Sheets and blankets can be used to cover the cardboard surfaces, just like a normal bed.\nCardboard was chosen for several reasons. According to recent studies, coronavirus can only survive on cardboard surfaces for 24 hours , whereas it lives for two to three days on materials such as wood, metal and plastic.\nEach bed can be shipped flat packed, and the corrugated cardboard is light but strong enough to support 150 to 200 kilograms. An average adult weighs just 62 kilograms.\nIt also minimises the environmental impact, as it can be easily recycled after use \u2013 if not used as an emergency burial device.\nABC Displays is sending a donation of cardboard beds to Leticia in the Amazon region on the border with Peru and Brazil. Leticia's biggest hospital has only five ventilators, reported the Bogota Post , and no intensive care unit beds. Colombia currently has over 25,300 coronavirus cases and has registered over 800 deaths.\nThe company will donate beds to the worst affected regions, and is offering to sell them to other local governments in places such as Peru that are looking for inexpensive solutions to bed shortages.

Seasonal patterns don\u2019t point to EUR/USD weakness in August, and the longer-term euro trend is upwards.\u201d\nThe July 31-Aug. 5 poll of more than 60 currency strategists showed the dollar was expected to continue to underperform against most major currencies over the coming 12 months, with a good chance of that weakness extending beyond a year.\nIndeed, more than half the strategists, or 33 of 62, in response to an additional question said the dollar\u2019s weakening trend would continue for at least another six months, including 24 respondents who expect it to run for more than a year.\nAbout a quarter, or 15 analysts, said it would be less than six months. While 11 said it would be less than three months, just three respondents said it was already over.\n\u201cFollowing some hesitancy in June and the first half of July, the negative forces acting on the USD have returned to the fore. The in principle approval by European Union leaders to the proposed recovery fund and the associated EUR/USD response has been the catalyst for a generalised move lower in the USD,\u201d said Gavin Friend, senior FX strategist at NAB.\n\u201cThis has some way to play out.\u201d\nThe euro traded below $1.10 as recently as May. But the single currency soared around 5% in July, marking its best monthly performance in a decade, with much of those gains coming after EU leaders agreed a 750 billion euro economic recovery fund, where it will borrow jointly for the first time - a major boost to regional cooperation.\nWhile the euro was not forecast to carry the same momentum, it was still expected to end the year on a high.\nThe single currency was expected to trade at about $1.18 in a year\u2019s time, around where it was last trading on Wednesday. That consensus view was the highest in a year and the range of forecasts pointed to higher highs and higher lows.\nReuters poll: EUR/USD outlook\nIn the derivatives markets, the one-year euro forward was last trading at $1.19, suggesting more upside to the currency\u2019s strength.\n\u201cThe euro has been significantly weaker post-financial crisis because global investors are much less confident of the financial architecture - in particular the role of fiscal policy in the European economy. Though they\u2019re less pessimistic about that today than they were a month ago,\u201d added SG\u2019s Juckes.\nTwenty-eight of 55 analysts who answered a separate question said major developed market currencies, most of which rose against the dollar in July, would perform better against the dollar over the next six months.\nTwelve said emerging market currencies, six said commodity-linked currencies, while the remaining nine respondents said all of those currencies.\n(For other stories from the August Reuters foreign exchange poll:)\nReporting by Hari Kishan and Rahul Karunakar; Polling by Sarmista Sen and Khushboo Mittal; Editing by Ross Finley and Alison Williams\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200828-39807", "label": 1, "title": "Lubbock Red Cross volunteers deployed to help with response to Hurricane Laura", "body": "LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - This is the fourth deployment for Brad Larson in his six years with the Red Cross South Plains Chapter.\nHe is meeting evacuees who are heading north as they get settled into Red Cross shelters.

This suggests that India\u2019s caseload could surpass the tallies in these two countries unless the trend reverses or a vaccine is developed.\nThough India has performed better than the two nations on several parameters such as case fatality rate (CFR) and recoveries, its steady rate of increase of cases raises serious concerns about a potential surge, keeping in mind the country\u2019s population.\nAlso read| Covid-19: What you need to know today\nSimilarities in geography and demography have caused a prolonged outbreak of Covid-19 in these countries, which is largely responsible for these three nations to be the ones hit worst in the world. The US is the world\u2019s third largest country by geographical area, Brazil fifth, and India seventh. As the infection wanes in one part of the country, it waxes in another. In terms of population, India is the second most populous country in the world, the US third, and Brazil sixth. Expectedly, per capita infection and death numbers are low for all three countries compared to smaller and less populous nations.\nDOUBLING RATE\nThe doubling rate refers to the number of days it will take for any region to double its caseload. So if there were 1,000 cases in a region on a particular day and the doubling rate at the time was five days, it would mean that the cases would touch 2,000 five days later.\nWhen Covid-19 cases in the United States touched two million on June 7, the country had a doubling rate of 60.2 days, and when Brazil hit the same caseload, its doubling rate was 35.7 days. As India touched two million cases on Thursday, it has a significantly worse doubling rate \u2013 22.7 days.\nBrazil crossed the two million-mark on July 16, incidentally the same day India crossed the million-mark. In the three weeks since, Brazil (which had twice India\u2019s caseload to begin with), added a little over 850,000 cases while India added a million cases in the same time.\nAlso read| Covid-19:\u2009India posts its second million in just 21 days\nIn fact, if cases in India continue to grow at the same rate they have till now, the doubling rate suggests that the next million cases may take just a little over two weeks.\nDEATHS, ACTIVE CASES & RECOVERIES\nActive cases \u2014 those that are currently infected \u2014 form a crucial statistic as they directly influence the load on a region\u2019s health care system. Of the two million cases in the US (when the US crossed that mark on June 7), 1,110,225, or 55.2% of the total caseload was active \u2013 the highest among the three counties.\nIndia has the second-highest number with 605300 active cases, or 29.9% of the total caseload. In Brazil, 571,141 (28.34% of total cases) were active when the country reached two million cases.\nThe current proportion of active cases in the US is 45.7% and Brazil 26.1%. The US has thus far seen a total of 4.97 million cases and Brazil, 2.86 million.\nDeaths is one category where India has performed significantly better than the other two countries. With 41,633 deaths till Thursday, India\u2019s case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.1% is among the better in the world, and is lower than the global average of 3.75%. It is also significantly better than the CFR of Brazil (3.81% with 76822 deaths) and the US (5.72% with 115050 fatalities), when both countries hit the two-million-case mark.\nIn terms of recoveries, the US fares the worst among the three countries with only 39.2% (785,657) of its two million cases recovered.

Our family was the most serious kind of refugees \u2014the kind that lived out of very few bags. We'd made our way from war-time buses out of Tehran to a pit-stop in Turkey, then on to nunneries in the Alps, relatives\u2019 cramped apartments in Paris, and downtown Los Angeles flophouses. We eventually found a home, but that life I led as a three year old seems to have left an impression. I\u2019ve rarely lived in a single space longer than a couple of years and I\u2019ve called half a dozen cities home. In New York , where I currently live, I have moved apartments 12 times.\nMy thirties had offered a ton of travel thanks to my life as a writer . I\u2019d gone to Australia and Indonesia for book festivals, Israel for an activist book project, Italy for a book tour, and London for a book launch. A personal love of road tripping had taken me all around the U.S., and I saw all but one of the states (North Dakota) before turning 40. Not knowing where my next night\u2019s bed was going to be was a great joy to me: travel was always synonymous with adventure.\nUntil it was not. I'd been sick with Lyme Disease for at least a decade, but a mold outbreak in my old Harlem apartment bought on new symptoms. I began to experience treatment-resistant insomnia and struggled to breath. My skin, meanwhile, started breaking out in weird rashes, and I suffered from headaches that felt like my brain was swelling. I was suddenly allergic to the world.\nSo much so, that I had to wear masks inside people\u2019s homes. I grew used to sleeping next to an oxygen tank\u2014yes, I owned an oxygen tank\u2014with its mask strapped snugly on my face. I was forced to leave my own apartment and find a new home, figuring the key to recovery was finding the right environment for my body to rest. I threw away almost all my belongings out of fear that they could be cross-contaminated (so advised the \u201cmold-avoider\u201d blogs I was reading at the time) and condensed my life\u2019s possessions into the size of a carry-on.\nI was suddenly allergic to the world.\nAt this point, I was traveling to save my life, in search of a new sterile, mold-free environment to call home. Not having roots was an agony, both mentally and physically. I could not embark on any sort of healing protocol; doctors refused to treat me when I didn\u2019t have a permanent address. Most people who heard my story just thought I had lost my mind.\nMy parents often called me, bewildered, asking where I was, and my friends could no longer keep track of me. I went from my apartment in New York to my parent\u2019s condo in Glendale, California, to my friend\u2019s apartment in San Francisco to my old teacher\u2019s bungalow in Santa Fe , where I stayed for half a year. I got sicker. Then I went on a small book tour I could only half complete because I was so ill, so it was back to my parents\u2019 and then to a residency in the hills of Sausalito, a beach house in Venice, a townhouse in Orange County, and then, finally, back to New York\u2014this time, to my current apartment in Queens, which I found after crashing in several spots around the city. All in all, I was without a real home for well over two years.\nEventually I got better. In New York, of all places, which shocked everyone including me. But I figured out why: it wasn\u2019t the city, it was just having a city. I had committed to a place and with that came stability\u2014space to unload, rooms to arrange, setting up a bed I chose, buying groceries I had control over, establishing a routine. For the past six months, I have improved more than I did in years because I gave into the illusion of permanence: a nest for good.\nAs I was setting up home in New York again, a friend asked, \u201cWhat will you do once you're completely well again?\u201d The answer shocked us both: travel. It\u2019s amazing how constant motion is part of my blood. Maybe my mother was right and my toddler education in refugee life was a conditioning for a lifetime of restlessness.\nAs I turned 42 this past January and was deciding how to celebrate, I thought, why not leave the country? It had been twenty years since I had gone to Paris , and back then I was a study abroad student, hustling around with French bread and wine in my backpack, sleeping a bare minimum in dirty, loud hostels in Pigalle. This time I wanted a slight upgrade: an old hotel, La Louisianne, kept coming up. It was where Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Cy Twombly, and Miles Davis stayed. It was old but clean I was assured, not fancy but not filthy either.\nI realized that just a few months ago, when I still wore masks constantly, an old Parisian dive would have been my worst nightmare.

Bottled water, pricey diapers and Burberry luxury trench coats are out.\nWelcome to America\u2019s pandemic consumer economy. And it\u2019s like nothing we\u2019ve seen before.\n\u201cEverything we knew about supply and demand, we can essentially throw out the window because consumer behavior has changed completely,\u201d said Piotr Dworczak, assistant professor of economics at Northwestern University.\nA Reuters analysis of a varied basket of goods shows how the COVID-19 crisis has upturned a decades-old consumer model for everything from clothing to food. This has given some companies surprising power to raise prices or withdraw discounts.\nMany of the new trends can be attributed to one factor, according to retail specialists: working from home.\nAlmost overnight, a consumer-driven economy with clearly delineated work and home spending, changed profoundly. Rising demand for certain items, as well as global supply-chain disruptions, has driven up prices.\nAmericans are now shelling out significantly more than a year before for coffee, eggs, sliced ham, ketchup and cheese, for example, according to the Reuters analysis of the latest pricing data from Nielsen Co, the Brewers Association and StyleSage Co.\nYet it\u2019s a complex picture, and some of the changes in behavior seem counter-intuitive during a time of deep economic uncertainty.\nDemand and prices have also increased for more expensive, or \"splurge\", items like $106 men's Nike NKE.N Air Max sneakers, $105 Lululemon LULU.O yoga pants and even a $1,500 Louis Vuitton LVMH.PA handbag.\nEconomists put this apparent discrepancy in behavior down to the fact that many people, unable to spend outside, have more cash in hand. Even many workers on furlough are receiving jobless benefits that match their wages under a federal stimulus plan.\n\u201cIf I were to consider the consumer situation right now, in a strange way, they may have more disposable income, if they kept their job,\u201d said Nirupama Rao, an assistant professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. \u201cOf course we\u2019re facing mass layoffs, but the bulk of people have maintained their wages and earnings.\u201d\nGraphic: Price vs unit sales comparison on a basket of goods from April to August -\n\u2018UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURE\u2019\nShoppers paid roughly 8% more on average for JM Smucker's SJM.N instant coffees, including Folger's and Dunkin', at bricks-and-mortar stores in the four weeks to Aug. 8 versus a year before, according to Nielsen data analyzed by Bernstein.\nRelated Coverage\n\nThey shelled out nearly 10% more for Kraft Heinz KHC.O sauces and about 5% extra for Tyson Foods' TSN.N sliced hams.\nSuch inflation might make commercial sense, given the bump in demand for home staples. But some consumer experts complain retailers and big brands are cutting back on promotions and using their power to shore up profits during a health crisis that has led to millions losing their livelihoods.\n\u201cBrand manufacturers have been fattening their pockets with profits while putting unprecedented pressure on the consumer who has to pay those higher prices,\u201d said Burt Flickinger, retail consultant at Strategic Resource Group.\nJM Smucker said it did not raise prices of its instant coffees in the four weeks to Aug. 8, but did cut back on some promotions for in-demand products. Kraft Heinz declined to comment, but said during earnings in July that second-quarter prices went up as it pulled some offers and discounts for scarce products. Tyson did not respond to a request for comment.\nOther industry experts point out that companies have had to grapple with costly production shifts to adapt to the new landscape. They note that before the pandemic, when costs were lower and there were more promotions and discounts, prices of Heinz sauces were declining.\nPre-COVID-19, tens of millions of commuters grabbed a coffee to-go en route to work. Suddenly, instead of 20-pound (9.1 kg) bags of coffee for restaurants, or large containers of ketchup, producers have had to switch to smaller, home-use packaging.\nAs ketchup, mayonnaise and vinegar sales surged, Kraft Heinz diverted resources to running these production lines around the clock, while suspending others. It added extra shifts for factory workers to make grocery-sized bottles.\nEgg suppliers, like market leader Cal-Maine Foods Inc CALM.O , have had to overcome a shortage of cartons.\n\u201cIf you look at eggs, before they\u2019d be powdered to send to restaurants and now they have to be put in cardboard containers to go to supermarkets,\u201d said Daniel Bachman, senior U.S. economist at Deloitte. \u201cIt took a high price to induce the change.\u201d\nYet consumer companies cannot take demand for granted and can be burnt by raising prices.\nPrices for bottled water and disposable diapers have gone up, while demand has fallen for most of the pandemic. People are unwilling to pay out extra when they can drink their own water at home, and can opt for reusable or cheaper generic diapers at a time when there\u2019s a lack of child daycare, some economists say.\n\u201cYou\u2019re at home anyway so you\u2019re not sending your child off somewhere in a diaper that fails,\u201d said Rao.\nGraphic: Nike Air Max, Lululemon legging discount levels go down this year -\nLockdowns have meant many Americans do not travel, eat out, or go to movie theaters. As they have not been commuting or taking kids to school, many are using less gas in their cars.\nSo they can now splash out on other things, perhaps.\nMichael Collins, a professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2019s consumer science department, calls this a \u201csubstitution effect.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear people behave as if they have different pots of money,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t eat out at all, so I have a couple of hundred dollars of new income not allocated to anything. I can substitute that money away from eating out and treat myself to other things.\u201d\nThis effect could help explain the rise in demand and prices for the Air Max. Nike sold about 63% of their online stocks of the shoes in July, compared with only 10% a year earlier, according to apparel data company StyleSage which collects sales information from brand websites.\nAir Max prices surged 10.5% on average versus a year before.\nPrices for Lululemon\u2019s yoga pants rose 7.2%, and about 45% of stocks were sold in July versus 15% the year before.\nMeanwhile, the price of Louis Vuitton\u2019s Neverfull MM Monogram handbag has risen 5% on its website since the start of May. In July, Louis Vuitton owner LVMH said sales momentum had picked up since June, even as its star label raised prices for a third time during the pandemic.\nThere are some limits, though.\nDemand for a Burberry BRBY.L woman's trench coat has declined, with only 3% of online stocks sold in July versus 14% a year earlier.\nIt\u2019s a snip at $2,245, down 3.5%.\nNike and Burberry did not respond to requests for comment, while LVMH declined to comment beyond its July remarks. Lululemon said it hadn\u2019t raised prices on some of its core yoga pant styles, including Align and Wunder Under, but had seen a significant rise in demand for yoga products since April. July sales reflected its \u201cWarehouse Sale\u201d offer that month.\nGraphic: Prices vs. unit sales on a small basket of apparel items during pandemic -\nMuch remains uncertain.\nThe U.S. epidemic and its economic consequences are moving targets, and it is unclear when - or even if - American life and consumer behavior will revert to \u201cnormal\u201d.\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s Rao said food producers had been reluctant to invest in permanent changes to retool factories. \u201cThey\u2019re hindered by the fact there\u2019s so much uncertainty as to how long this will last.\u201d\nIndeed, consumer demand, as well as brands\u2019 pricing power, could change in the coming weeks and months as many Americans feel more financial pain.\nThe government\u2019s first round of COVID-19-related benefits expired on July 31, leaving about 30 million unemployed Americans without the $600 weekly boost that sustained their households and promoted some discretionary spending.\nWith the money spigot turned off, analysts say recessionary spending behavior should take hold, with consumers cutting back.\nThe University of Wisconsin\u2019s Collins said loan forbearance on mortgages, credit cards and student loans since the spring had also helped consumers.\n\u201cEventually that will all end, and people could start to tighten up again.\u201d\nReporting By Nick Carey, Richa Naidu and Siddharth Cavale; Additional reporting by Silvia Aloisi; Editing by Vanessa O\u2019Connell and Pravin Char\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200619-51051", "label": 0, "title": "Saudi Arabia crude exports rose to 10.237 million bpd in April: JODI | Reuters", "body": "By Reuters Staff\n2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude oil exports in April rose to 10.237 million barrels per day (bpd) from 7.391 million bpd in March, official data showed on Thursday.\nThe country\u2019s crude output rose by 2.274 mln bpd to 12.007 mln bpd in April, the official figures showed.

Both called off primary election-night rallies in Ohio on Tuesday.\nBiden\u2019s virtual events will be held in the lead-up to the next round of primaries to decide who should get the Democratic nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November. The two states will vote on Tuesday along with Ohio and Arizona.\nLate Wednesday, Trump also canceled two campaign events, including a fundraiser in Denver scheduled for Thursday.\n\u201cOut of an abundance of caution from the coronavirus outbreak, the President has decided to cancel his upcoming events in Colorado and Nevada,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\nUntil Wednesday, Trump had sought to play down the extent of the coronavirus threat and has held several rallies in recent weeks aimed at stealing the spotlight from the Democrats.\nOn Tuesday his campaign said he would hold a \u201cCatholics for Trump\u201d event in Milwaukee on March 19.\nIn a somber address to the nation on Wednesday night, he however acknowledged the pandemic threat but expressed confidence the U.S. public health system could handle it.\nBiden, a moderate who has emerged as the race\u2019s clear front-runner, and Sanders, a democratic socialist, have both criticized the Trump administration over its response to the outbreak.\n\u201cThis is a matter, this whole coronavirus - is a matter of presidential leadership,\u201d Biden said in Philadelphia on Tuesday night after decisively winning four of the six states that voted.\nBiden said he would deliver an address on the U.S. response to the virus in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday.\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the highly contagious virus, is a sometimes fatal respiratory illness.

Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday told reporters decisions about events would be made \u201cliterally on a day-by-day basis.\u201d\nState officials have told constituents to consider voting early if they are worried.\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine on Wednesday urged voters to participate, but try to avoid crowds.\n\u201cPeople should think about trying to vote at a time when there is a smaller crowd,\u201d DeWine said, suggesting that many polling places are less crowded in mid-afternoon. Voters also still have time to cast their ballots by mail, he said.\nArizona officials reminded voters of a Wednesday deadline to vote by mail.\nSeparately, organizers on Wednesday called off a March 27 rally in Detroit that was to be hosted by former first lady Michelle Obama.

Social distancing rules were largely ignored.\nDistinctive yellow minivans used as buses were full, with some passengers struggling to find space to enter vehicles.\nHowever, in a crucial difference to pre-lockdown life, most people on the streets of Lagos wore face masks.\nIn the capital Abuja, in central Nigeria, many businesses were still closed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have money in my pocket.

Worldwide, close to 3,100 people have succumbed to the illness even as a clear shift in the crisis was emerging, with nine times as many cases recorded outside China as inside, according to the UN health agency. Andorra, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Jordan, Latvia, Portugal, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia were among countries that confirmed their first cases, along with Senegal, which became the second sub-Saharan African country to do so. All of the US deaths have occurred in the state of Washington, where officials warned residents the battle against the disease was shifting from containment to mitigation. \"The risk for all of us of becoming infected will be increasing,\" said Jeff Duchin, a health officer in King County where five of the deaths occurred. The district is home to Seattle, a city with a population of more than 700,000 people. The White House, which has been accused of downplaying the threat from the virus, continued to strike a bullish tone. Vice President Mike Pence declared that a treatment \"could literally be available by this summer, or early fall.\" He was likely referring to remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed by the pharmaceutical firm Gilead that has already been used to treat one US patient and was moving toward two expansive final stage trials in Asia. Pence also announced American pharmaceuticals were teaming up in a consortium to fight the virus, and said that South Korea and Italy, two of the hardest-hit nations, would screen all their airline passengers bound for the US. Despite its world-class hospitals and cutting edge research, the US is viewed as vulnerable to an epidemic because of glaring disparities in its health care system, including nearly 28 million people without coverage. - 'Window of opportunity' - With fears of a pandemic on the rise after the virus emerged in China late last year, the World Health Organization urged countries to stock up on critical care ventilators to treat patients with severe symptoms. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a \"window of opportunity\" remained to contain the outbreak, noting that \"more than 130 countries have not detected any cases yet.\" Globally, the virus has infected nearly 90,000 people in more than 60 nations. Italy, Europe's worst-affected country with around 1,700 infections, said Monday its deaths from the virus had jumped 18 to 52. The outbreak has raised fears for the world economy, with the OECD slashing its global growth forecast by half a percentage point to 2.4 percent, the worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. But strength on Wall Street -- which rebounded from sharp losses last week to post gains of more than five percent Monday -- helped European markets emerge from the red after governments and central banks said they would step in if needed to soften the blow. China's economy has halted with large swathes of the country under quarantine or subject to strict travel restrictions. Other countries have enacted their own containment measures including travel restrictions, locking down towns and suspending major events. The Louvre -- the world's most visited museum -- was closed on Sunday and Monday after staff refused to work while the UN headquarters in Geneva said it was closing to visitors. In Italy, tourist hotpots including the Duomo in Milan reopened to visitors but access was limited to avoid overcrowding in a bid to contain the virus. Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden barred flights from Iran while France, Germany and Britain said they would send aid to the Middle Eastern nation. Iran reported 12 more deaths on Monday, raising the country's toll to 66, the second biggest after China's, while its overall number of cases rose to 1,501. - South Korea sect - China reported 42 more deaths on Monday -- all in central Hubei province, bringing the death toll to 2,912. The pathogen is believed to have originated in a market that sold wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan. Overall, China recorded just 202 new infections however, the lowest daily rise since late January, bringing the nationwide total to over 80,000, as massive quarantine efforts paid off. The WHO says the virus appears to particularly hit people over the age of 60 and those already weakened by other illnesses. Its mortality rate is between two and five percent. South Korea, the worst affected outside China, reported nearly 500 new cases on Monday, raising its total past 4,000. Four more people died there, taking the toll to 22. Half of South Korea's cases are linked to a sect whose leader Lee Man-hee apologized Monday for the spread of the disease.

States and local governments have issued \u201cstay-at-home\u201d or \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders affecting more than 90% of Americans to curb the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, and abruptly stopping economic activity in the country.\n\u201cEconomists have long imagined over the years what a new Great Depression would look like, but today they can stop thinking about it,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. \u201cThings will plainly never be the same again for consumers and factories where everyone in the country will have to make do with less.\u201d\nRetail sales plunged 8.7% last month, the biggest decline since the government started tracking the series in 1992, the Commerce Department said. Data for February was revised slightly up to show retail sales slipping 0.4% instead of falling 0.5% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales tumbling 8.0% in March. Compared to March last year, retail sales dropped 6.2%.\nThe $46.2 billion decrease in sales in March was almost equal in a single month to the $49.1 billion peak-to-trough decline that unfolded over 16 months in the Great Recession.\nThe Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in its April \u201cBeige Book\u201d report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide that \u201ceconomic activity contracted sharply and abruptly across all regions in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s Census Bureau, which compiles the retail sales report said though \u201cmany businesses are operating on a limited capacity or have ceased operations completely,\u201d it had \u201cdetermined estimates in this release meet publication standards.\u201d\nLast month\u2019s decrease in retail sales reflected depressed receipts at car dealerships, with auto sales crashing 25.6%. With millions at home and crude oil prices collapsing amid worries of a deep global recession, gasoline prices have dropped, which led to a 17.2% decline in sales at service stations.\nIn addition, the closure of non-essential retailers knocked sales at clothing down 50.5% last month. Receipts at furniture stores collapsed 26.8% and spending at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores plunged 23.3%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores decreased 15.1%.\nThere were also steep declines in receipts at restaurants and bars, which stopped in-person service and moved to take-out and delivery service. Though some businesses, including restaurants, have shifted to online sales, the volumes were insufficient to close the gap from social distancing measures.\nSales at restaurants and bars dropped 26.5% last month.\nThe drag on sales from social restrictions far outweighed a 3.1% surge in receipts at online retailers like Amazon AMZN.O , and grocery stores and pharmacies as consumers stocked up on household essentials such as food, toilet paper, cleaning supplies and medication. Grocery store sales soared 26.9% and receipts at healthcare outlets jumped 4.3%. Sales at building material stores rose 1.3%.\nStocks on Wall Street fell, with the S&P 500 recoiling from a four-week high, on the raft of weak data and dismal first-quarter earnings reports. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury bond prices rose.\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 1.7% in March after a downwardly revised 0.2% drop in February. These so-called core retail sales were previously reported to have been unchanged in February. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.\nDespite March\u2019s increase in core retail sales, economists are forecasting consumer spending plunging at an annualized rate of at least 17.0% in the first quarter, which would be the weakest performance since record keeping started in 1947.\nConsumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. It grew at a 1.8% pace in the fourth quarter, with the overall economy expanding at a 2.1% rate over that period. Economists see no respite for consumer spending in the second quarter, with estimates as deep as a 41% rate of decline, despite a historic $2.3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for cash payments to some families and boosted unemployment benefit checks. About 16.8 million people have filed claims for unemployment benefits since March 21.\nAnother report from the Fed on Wednesday showed manufacturing production plummeted 6.3% last month, the biggest decrease since February 1946.\nA fourth report from the New York Fed showed factory activity in New York state slumped to a record low in April.\nWith March data coming in severely weak, economists are estimating the economy contracted at as much as a 10.8% rate in the first quarter, which would be the steepest drop in gross domestic product since 1947.\nFirst-quarter GDP will also take a hit from an inventory drawdown as the coronavirus depresses imports.\nEconomists believe the economy entered recession in March.

For one, the BOJ extended the maturity of corporate bonds it accepts to five years from the current three years.\nThe BOJ also tweaked a rule limiting to 25% the maximum amount of CP and corporate bonds it holds per entity, raising the ceiling to 50% for CP and 30% for corporate bonds.\nThe cap for the BOJ\u2019s buying of CP per entity was raised to 500 billion yen and that for corporate bonds to 300 billion yen, from the current 100 billion yen.\nThe BOJ removed loose guidance pledging to buy government bonds so its holdings increase at an annual pace of roughly 80 trillion yen.\nInstead, it pledged to buy as much as needed without a limit, to achieve its 0% long-term interest rate target.\nRemoving the guidance on its bond buying is largely a symbolic move. The BOJ has only purchased less than 20 trillion yen per year, as the central bank\u2019s huge presence in the market allows it to control yields with fewer purchases.\nStill, the move will help ease market jitters by clarifying the BOJ\u2019s resolve to ramp up money printing to keep borrowing costs stably low, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters.\nIn a surprise move, the BOJ decided to pay financial institutions for borrowing money from the central bank under a new loan scheme aimed at rescuing firms hit by the pandemic.\nUnder the scheme created in March, the BOJ extends loans by up to one year at zero interest to financial institutions.\nIn a move aimed at encouraging commercial banks to boost lending, the BOJ will now pay a 0.1% interest to financial institutions that tap the loan programme.\nIt also expanded the range of assets it accepts as collateral from financial institutions to include mortgage loans and other household debt - a move aimed at preventing commercial banks from pulling money out from borrowers hit by job losses or declining income.\nThe BOJ will also create as early as next month another programme aimed at encouraging financial institutions to boost lending to mom-and-pop firms, many of whom are deprived of safety nets to prevent them from going under.\nReporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"RECORDID": "20200210-42971", "label": -1, "title": "Countries rush to build diagnostic capacity as coronavirus spreads", "body": "By Julie Steenhuysen and Stephanie Nebehay\nCHICAGO/GENEVA (Reuters) - A week ago, only two laboratories in Africa could diagnose the novel coronavirus that originated in China and is rapidly spreading around the world. As of Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) expected every nation in Africa to be able to diagnose the disease.\nThe rush reflects a global push for diagnostic capabilities, particularly in developing countries, in hopes of averting a global pandemic. But it is being slowed by a desperate need for virus samples necessary to validate the tests.\n\"Without vital diagnostic capacity, countries are in the dark as to how far and wide the virus has spread and who has coronavirus or another disease with similar symptoms,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva on Monday.\nAs of early Monday, there had been 40,235 confirmed cases reported in China and 909 deaths, as well as 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death.\nMost of the testing is being done by public health laboratories. But several companies including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, GenScript Biotech Corp and Co-Diagnostics Inc have developed tests and are taking steps to get them validated for clinical use.\nRoche is distributing coronavirus tests developed by Tib Molbiol of Berlin for research use on some of its instruments while developing a test of its own. Abbott Laboratories also is working on a test.\nWHO has activated a network of 15 referral laboratories that can support national efforts in confirming new cases, and has identified 168 labs globally with the technology to diagnose the virus.\nTechnicians must be trained to run the tests locally to avoid delays associated with having to send them to centralized labs.\nOn Tuesday, WHO is convening a two-day meeting of hundreds of researchers and manufacturers to address the outbreak.\nWORKLOAD ON LABS IS 'EXTREME'\nResearchers are also working to develop antibody tests that can tell whether someone has been exposed to the virus. They could help answer how broadly this virus has spread, and whether there are milder cases not being detected, Dr. Mike Ryan, head of the WHO emergency program, told reporters.\nChina appears to have adequate stock of the materials needed to perform diagnostic tests, but there is a limited number of trained technicians who can run them. \"The workload on those labs is extreme,\" Ryan said.\nOutside of China, manufacturers are quickly developing tests based on the genetic code of the virus. Those tests still need to be validated with actual virus samples, for which access has been challenging.\nLive isolation of the virus allows a huge advance in diagnostics and potential advances in therapeutics and vaccine development, Ryan said.\nGenScript, which has offices in New Jersey and Nanjing, China, has developed a test available to researchers. It cannot be used as a diagnostic until it has been tested in hundreds of virus samples.\n\"In China, we couldn't get to the samples directly because we don't have a lab that can handle the virus,\" said Hong Li, a GenScript scientist.\nThe company has sent its test kits to Chinese health officials to assess their validity. \"Because other companies in China are also doing that, we don't know when it will be our turn,\" said Eric Wang, GenScript's head of marketing.\nUtah-based Co-Diagnostics on Monday said it has started shipping its test, which is available for research purposes, to clients. Chief Scientific Officer Brent Satterfield said last week that the company has been struggling to find clinical virus samples to validate the test for use as a diagnostic.\nThermo Fisher developed its tests based on the genetic code of the virus, and ran computer models to validate it.\nThe company has been providing its test to countries and health ministries with access to virus samples, said Thermo Fisher executive Joshua Trotta. \"They will evaluate our kits and make a determination of what is the best test to deploy.\"\nMeanwhile, Thermo Fisher is scaling up production as countries prepare for more cases.

Scott McKeen asked council to discontinue the remaining two years of the program, saying he got complaints from many people who saw the program as lavish.\nCouncillors Aaron Paquette and Ben Henderson and Mayor Don Iveson voted to keep the rebate, in part because it helps support the city's Energy Transition Strategy to reduce greenhouse gases.\nMcKeen, who's had an e-bike for several years, said he feels guilty on both sides.\n\"I don't love the idea of being the one blamed for getting ready of e-bike rebates,\" McKeen told CBC News Friday.\nMcKeen said he'd support another program in the future with $100 rebates instead.\n\"But $500 to $750 is more money than a lot of people would ever spend on a bike,\" McKeen said. \"So really it was a program for people with means \u2014 to give people who already have some financial wherewithal, more money.\"\nE-bikes range in price between $2,000 to $10,000.\nUniversal appeal\n\"If you've tried an e-bike, chances are you own an e-bike,\" Hodgson said.\nHodgson said the five-day rebate blitz exponentially exposed more people to the appeal of e-bikes.\n\"We're still selling the bikes every single day,\" he said, attributing some of the demand to an increased awareness through that rebate period.\n\"It had a lot of people's eyes open to be able to say, 'oh an e-bike, this must be for more people than just again the elderly or the physically challenged: this must be for everybody.\"\n\"So I want to learn more, I want to know more.\"\n'This is our Hawaii money' - Customers told Kelly Hodgson\nPeople are attracted to e-bikes for a variety of reasons, he said, including fitness, increased mobility, cutting down the cost of commuting to work, Hodgson said.\nWith the option of choosing the level of assistance on an e-bike, riders are able to go farther than on a traditional bike.\n\"They'd probably cap out at 20 kilometers but would love to see what a 60 km - 70 km ride would look like,\" Hodgson noted. \"And with the assistance of an e-bike they can do that.\"\nHodgson also started to notice a different kind of customer coming in during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"A number of them were saying, 'this is our Hawaii money or this is our Mexico money that we were planning on going away',\" he said. \"And obviously with what's going on in COVID, they wanted to enjoy more of our city and our province and tour through e-bike.\"\nMacFynn echoed the wide-spread use of an e-bike for people looking to be more active or those with limited abilities.\n\"People like my wife, who has M.S. \u2014 it was a gateway to getting out and being active and not being fearful that they wouldn't be able to get home on their bicycle or that they'd have to walk their bike up the hill.\"\nRebate program or not, MacFynn is worried he's not going to be able to get enough stock in, citing a shortage of supply in North America.\nMcKeen is resolute that the program was inappropriate and even insulting to people who've been laid off or are struggling financially during COVID-19.\n\"This program hit a very narrow segment of the community and I'm not sure if that segment of the community needed that much help.\"\nMcKeen said he'd rather see the $100,000 used toward bike infrastructure, like lock-ups, to encourage people to ride their bikes to shop, dine and get around in general.\n@natashariebe"}, {"RECORDID": "20200611-32975", "label": -1, "title": "Global stocks tumble, safe-haven assets rally on downbeat Fed outlook | Reuters", "body": "By Herbert Lash\n4 Min Read\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets fell sharply on Thursday in their worst sell-off since markets crashed in mid-March, while safe-haven assets rose after the Federal Reserve\u2019s sobering outlook cast doubt on hopes for a V-shaped recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\nAll three major U.S. stock indexes fell by more than 5%, Asia\u2019s 10-day winning streak ended [.T] and major European bourses declined roughly 4%.

A 2014 study found that only 5 percent of Beijing residents had eaten wildlife in the previous year.   On a farm near Beijing last September, a group of conservationists put in a call to police: They\u2019d found thousands of live birds being stored in a barn. Police seized and released the birds\u2014about 10,000 in all\u2014which had been caught illegally with traps and were destined for restaurants and markets in southern China. Among them were yellow-breasted buntings, critically endangered songbirds whose numbers have been in freefall, largely because people in parts of China want to eat them.\nVendors in Beijing wear protective masks as they sell vegetables. A 2014 study found that only 5 percent of Beijing residents had eaten wildlife in the previous year.\nThe spread of a deadly strain of coronavirus, sourced to a wildlife market in Wuhan and now a global epidemic, has thrust China\u2019s live wild animal trade into the spotlight. On January 26, China announced a ban on its wild animal trade until the crisis is over. Images of sick, suffering animals in markets, and videos of bats boiling alive in bowls of soup have circulated in media, sparking outrage globally and creating the impression that buying live wild animals for eating is a megascale phenomenon in China.\nThe reality is more nuanced. In Guangzhou, a city of 14 million in the southeast and a frequent destination for yellow-breasted buntings, eating wildlife appears exceedingly common. In Beijing, it\u2019s exceedingly rare.\nIn reality, to many Chinese consuming wild animals is a cultural outlier. State-controlled media outlets such as China Daily have published scathing editorials denouncing the practice and calling for a permanent wildlife trade ban. These calls in turn are amplified by thousands of Chinese citizens on state-censored social media networks such as Weibo, indicating that the government seems to be letting the momentum build.\nThe scale of the live wild animal trade in China is unclear, experts say. Many animals are poached, imported, and exported illegally\u2014for food, medicine, trophies, and pets. The Chinese traditional medicine industry, which heavily relies on ancient belief in the healing powers of animal parts, is a massive driver of the trade.\nThe government allows 54 wild species to be bred on farms and sold for consumption, including minks, ostriches, hamsters, snapping turtles, and Siamese crocodiles. Many wild animals, such as snakes and birds of prey, are poached and brought to state-licensed farms, says Zhou Jinfeng, secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, an NGO in Beijing that helped with the bird rescue in September. Zhou says some farmers claim that their animals were bred legally in captivity for conservation but then sell them to markets or collectors.\nIt\u2019s unknown how many live wildlife markets exist in China, but experts estimate they could number in the hundreds. For buyers, frogs are a common and inexpensive wildlife dish, says Peter Li, China policy specialist at Humane Society International and professor in East Asian politics at the University of Houston-Downtown. On the high end, Li says, only the rich can afford soup made with palm civet (a cat-size mammal native to jungles throughout Southeast Asia), fried cobra, or braised bear paw.\nSuch food was not part of Li\u2019s experience growing up. \u201cMy parents never cooked wild animals, and [we\u2019ve] never eaten them. I\u2019ve never had snake\u2014much less cobra.\u201d\nRebecca Wong, assistant professor of sociology and behavioral sciences at the City University of Hong Kong, argues in her 2019 book about the illegal wildlife trade in China that consuming wildlife \u201cis a common phenomenon in mainland China.\u201d But Wong cautions against stereotyping this practice, arguing that the idea of the \u201cAsian superconsumer\u201d is a myth and that complex motivations are at play, including peer pressure, societal pressure, and the impulse to chase status.\nA 2014 study that surveyed more than a thousand people in five Chinese cities found radically different practices in different parts of the country. In Guangzhou, 83 percent of people interviewed had eaten wildlife in the previous year. In Shanghai, 14 percent had, and in Beijing, just 5 percent. Nationwide, more than half the respondents said wild animals shouldn\u2019t be eaten at all.\nCharles, 22, and Cordelia, 18, are university students from the Guangzhou area, where wild animal consumption is purportedly high. I spoke with each through Instagram, where they use English names. (Both asked National Geographic not to use their last names\u2014Instagram is banned in China, but like many young people, they use VPNs to access it.)\nCharles says eating wild animals is very common in his community, but his family doesn\u2019t partake much, and he eats only occasionally and out of curiosity. \u201cNowadays, older people buy them more than younger,\u201d he says. He thinks it\u2019s because of education.\nCordelia, who lives in downtown Guangzhou, says the practice isn\u2019t at all common in her family or community. \u201cMy friends and family don\u2019t really like eating wild animals, and we think it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d She explains that she sees it as \u201cdisrespectful and a strong violation to mother nature.\u201d She believes the ongoing epidemic may move others to see it that way too. \u201cI think after this terrible spread of coronavirus, citizens will realize that the belief that eating wild animals is beneficial is not reliable.\u201d\nCordelia and Charles both support making the ban on the wild animal trade permanent, and they say they\u2019ve seen an outpouring of support for it on Weibo.\nCordelia\u2019s mention that belief in health benefits drives consumption is reflected on market floors. Live animals sell for a higher price\u2014often two to three times more\u2014than dead ones. \u201cPeople think food is more nutritious if it\u2019s live and fresh,\u201d Li says. \u201cAn animal may be dying, but it\u2019s alive.\u201d\nIn markets, animals \u201care dying, they are thirsty, they are in rusty cages and totally dirty,\u201d Li says. They may be missing limbs or have open wounds from their capture in the wild or injuries sustained during transport. \u201cThe traders don\u2019t handle them gently\u2014they smash the cages down to the floor when unloading and loading. The animals suffer a lot.\u201d\nThe chaos of the trade enables the spread of zoonotic diseases\u2014those that spread from animals to humans\u2014says Christian Walzer, chief global veterinarian at the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society. Wild animals, he explains, can carry viruses that \u201cin a normal world, would not come into contact with humans.\u201d These carriers aren\u2019t sick\u2014they\u2019re simply \u201csilent reservoirs.\u201d But as we encroach into animals\u2019 habitats, we increase our exposure.\nSeventy percent of zoonotic diseases come from wildlife, says Erin Sorrell, an assistant research professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C. The diseases can be notoriously devastating: HIV, Ebola, and SARS are among those that have made the leap from wildlife to humans, spawning international outbreaks.\nIn wildlife markets in China and Southeast Asia, there may be 40 species\u2014birds, mammals, reptiles\u2014\u201cstacked on top of each other,\u201d Walzer says. The mixing of air and bodily secretions allows viruses to exchange, potentially creating new strains. Walzer sums it up as a \u201ccauldron of contagion.\u201d\nEvidence points to bats as the source of the Wuhan coronavirus. It\u2019s unclear which species then transmitted the disease to humans, but in an assessment of the Wuhan market, the coronavirus was detected in the live wild animal section.\nMany conservationists I spoke to believe that China\u2019s temporary ban of the wildlife trade\u2014which applies to all markets, grocery stores, and online sales and includes a quarantine on all breeding facilities\u2014is likely to be largely successful. The government has set up a hotline for people to report violations. \u201cThis is an emergency situation,\u201d Peter Li says. \u201cEveryone is watching. Any trader who violates the ban will be reported.\u201d On top of that, fear of coronavirus likely reduces demand\u2014even if sellers are willing to offer live animals illegally, people may not want to buy them.\nChina has resorted to a ban before. In 2003, at the height of SARS epidemic, which is believed to have originated in civets, the government issued a temporary ban on the wildlife trade. Six months later, it lifted the ban, allowing breeding facilities to resume business. Li says it\u2019s difficult to say whether the overall live wildlife trade has grown during the past two decades, but he believes that more of the transactions have gone underground to evade law enforcement.\nThere\u2019s always the risk that this could happen again, Sorrell notes. \u201cThere\u2019s been a 15-to-16-year gap [since SARS], but who\u2019s to say it\u2019s going to be another 16 years before we see the next disease emerge from a live animal market?\u201d\nTo make the temporary ban permanent, there would need to be clarification on what it actually encompasses. Some of its terms are vague, leaving them open to interpretation at the local law enforcement level. For example, does the ban include dried wildlife parts, such as bone and scales? It should, several experts tell me, but as written, it\u2019s unclear.\nA permanent ban would face strong opposition from business interests, Li says. The State Forestry and Grassland Department, which is responsible for issuing licenses to wildlife breeders, \u201chas long been a spokesperson for the wildlife interest,\u201d he says. (A forestry department official had not responded to a request for comment before publication.)\nSorrell emphasizes the need for caution in the pursuit of a permanent ban.\n\u201cI would love to see wildlife be removed from markets, full stop,\u201d she says. But if a ban is rushed without careful consideration, the entire wildlife trade could move underground, making it \u201ceven more dangerous for [a product] to be consumed because we\u2019re not seeing where it\u2019s being consumed or where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\u201cFor any ban to be effective, it will be important to get buy-in from citizens,\u201d adds Caroline Dingle, an evolutionary biologist in the conservation forensics lab at Hong Kong University, who studies wildlife crime. \u201cPeople need to believe that consuming wild animals is bad for them personally for any ban to work long-term.\u201d\nIf a permanent ban is adopted, Li says, it would be important for the government to buy out or compensate farmers to make it possible for them to pursue a different livelihood.\nMeanwhile, for yellow-breasted buntings, verging on extinction because of recent rapid consumption, something more has to give. It\u2019s already against the law to catch the birds, but that hasn\u2019t slowed their trade.\nFor Cordelia, the 18-year-old university student from Guangzhou, life is at a standstill. School is closed, and she can\u2019t visit her family. Reflecting on the biological crisis that emerged from a cultural practice she can\u2019t relate to, she says, \u201cI believe nature gives back to us what we give to it.\u201d\nBut she draws my attention to the unity she\u2019s seen in the wake of the crisis and the outcry on Weibo and in Chinese newspapers. \u201cI think,\u201d she types over Instagram, \u201crevolutionary change is highly possible.\u201d"}, {"RECORDID": "20200726-3573", "label": 1, "title": "Korean Air becomes latest carrier to stop selling most first-class seats", "body": "Flying in international first class is the holy grail of the miles and points world.\u00a0This exclusive experience typically includes a top-notch, super-private seat , restaurant-quality dining and a plethora of onboard amenities .\nHowever, during and after the coronavirus pandemic, airlines estimate that there\u2019s going to be little demand for these luxurious seats .

First-class flights to LAX and JFK are still showing operated by a mix of the A380 and 747-8, so fans of the double-decker airplane can still enjoy those jets in style.\nWe\u2019ve heard reports from readers that they were offered a full refund or a route change if they were booked on a first-class itinerary that\u2019s no longer offered.\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly Korean plans to do with its planes that are equipped with a first-class hard product. Even if the airline doesn\u2019t sell the cabin, it could offer the seats as a buy-up upgrade for business class passengers, or it could let elite frequent flyers assign them for free. Of course, the carrier could also decide to reinstate first-class availability on flights if it determines that there\u2019s adequate demand. We reached out to Korean and will update the story if we hear back.\nVideo: FAA Investigates Drone Sighting Near Teterboro Airport (CBS New York)\nBarber Offers Free Haircuts In Central Park\nPolice Respond To Altercation At Roosevelt Mall In Garden City\nMadison, New Jersey, Reimagines Annual Christmas Parade With Social Distancing, COVID Safety In Mind\nMild Temperatures Bring Families Outdoors For Post-Thanksgiving Activities\nNew York State Commits To Study Into How To Make Southern State Parkway Safer\nHealth Officials, Local Leaders Preparing For Surge In COVID Cases Following Thanksgiving\nBlack Friday Scaled Back This Year\nOperation Santa Brings Holiday Cheer To Kids In Madison, N.J.\nMan Takes New York Post Delivery Truck On Joy Ride\nATM Robbery Caught On Camera\nBlack Friday Buzz Not The Same This Year\nSantaCon Pub Crawl Canceled In New York City Due to Pandemic\nMacy's Closed On Thanksgiving, Stores Open Early For Black Friday\nNew Jersey Diner Feeds All Patrons For Free On Thanksgiving\nLarge Sinkhole Swallows Car In Maspeth, Queens\nDespite COVID's Impact, Americans Celebrate Thanksgiving With Friends, Family And Love\nKorean\u2019s move to eliminate first-class on most long-haul routes is reminiscent of what it did in mid-2019. On June 1, 2019, the airline removed first-class seats from 27 shorter-haul international routes . On many of the aircraft that operated these routes, business and first-class cabins were virtually identical , so the only real difference was the onboard service.\nKorean Air first-class awards used to be phenomenally easy to book, but all that changed when Chase Ultimate Rewards  dropped Korean Air as a transfer partner. Now the only way to earn a meaningful number of Korean SkyPass miles quickly is by transferring points from Marriott \u2014 at a 3:1 ratio. So even though first-class may be eliminated, it hasn\u2019t been all that easy to book the cabin for quite some time.\nRelated: Is COVID threatening the future of international first class?\nKorean Air is just one of the latest international carriers to eliminate (most) of its first-class flying.\nLong-haul international first class had been falling out of favor well before the coronavirus pandemic began. Some airlines, like Asiana (another South Korean carrier), discontinued first class entirely.\nA number of different factors contributed to this, including airlines opting to replace their superjumbo jets with smaller, more fuel-efficient planes such as the 787 and A350 , where first class takes up too much space. At the same time, airlines have improved the business class experience so much ( with many now offering fully enclosed suites ) that first class started to become obsolete.\nAnd now the pandemic will likely be the nail in the coffin for these exclusive cabins \u2014 at least in the short term. Depending on how long the recovery takes, we may see airlines restart first-class service, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess when that\u2019ll be.\nRelated: These airlines have stopped offering first class due to the pandemic\nThe days of flying in a luxurious first-class suite may be coming to an end.\nKorean Air is the latest international airline to remove first-class inventory for the foreseeable future. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens as the world recovers from the pandemic, but the future of premium travel may really be all-in on business class.\nFeatured photo by Alberto Riva/The Points Guy\nSPONSORED: With states reopening, enjoying a meal from a restaurant no longer just means curbside pickup.\nAnd when you do spend on dining, you should use a credit card that will maximize your rewards and potentially even score special discounts.

And even as places like California moved to a near-lockdown status, the immigration courts pressed on largely as usual, triggering bitter complaints and dire warnings.\nSome of the most pointed complaints came from lawyers involved in hearings stemming from President Donald Trump\u2019s remain-in-Mexico policy instituted last year, which requires most asylum seekers who enter from Mexico to return to that country to await a chance to appear before a U.S. immigration judge.\n\u201cUpdate from SD #MPP court: we are the only attys here so far w 50 asylum seekers filing in to the small waiting room,\u201d Human Rights First lawyer Robyn Barnard wrote on Twitter . \u201cNo hand sanitizer.

So many little babies here today. #COVID19  #shutitdown  #parolethemin\nWhile most other federal courts are under the control of the Judicial branch, immigration courts are part of the Justice Department itself, with Department of Homeland Security lawyers serving essentially as prosecutors.\nMany involved in the immigration court process said they detected a disconnect between the aggressive measures most state and federal courts have rolled out this week and the modest steps taken by DOJ\u2019s Executive Office of Immigration Review.\nThe president of the immigration judges\u2019 union, Ashley Tabaddor, said Tuesday that the Trump administration\u2019s failure to close the immigration courts showed health concerns were taking a back seat to \u201cpolitically-driven law enforcement policies.\u201d\n\u201cAt every court everyone is basically in panic mode because the appropriate measures have not been taken to protect everyone from exposure,\u201d Tabaddor told reporters on a conference call. \u201cThe politicization of the immigration courts has progressed to infecting the basic decision-making process of the agency as to the health and safety of all involved\u2026. An independent immigration court would\u2019ve never succumbed to those kinds of pressures.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s decision to press on with most hearings has forged an unusual alliance, with the lawyers who advocate for immigrants and those who press for their deportation joining together to call for a temporary halt to hearings.\n\u201cCOVID-19 not discriminate between a DHS trial attorney, private counsel, the respondents or court employees. We are all in it together,\u201d Tabbador said. \u201cEveryone is at risk.\u201d\n\u201cImmigration courtrooms are not large enough and parties sit within arm\u2019s reach of other.\nWaiting rooms, elevators and hallways are crowded, particularly in large courts\u2026.in today\u2019s climate, holding in-person hearings is exacerbating these dangerous conditions,\u201d said Fanny Behar of the American Federation of Government Employees local representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement trial attorneys.\nDOJ officials have previously dismissed criticism from the immigration judges\u2019 union as a backlash to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to have the union decertified.\nThe Justice Department has made some recent changes to immigration court schedules, closing the court in Seattle starting last Friday. At 10:49 p.m. Eastern Sunday night, EOIR announced on Twitter that group status hearings known as \u201cmaster calendar\u201d sessions scheduled through April 10 were being postponed for immigrants not held in custody.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday night, an EOIR spokesman said: \u201cEOIR continues to evaluate the information available from public health officials to inform the decisions regarding the operational status of each immigration court. \u201c\nHowever, individual scheduled hearings were not covered by the announcement nor were those for those in detention. \u201cAll other hearings proceeding,\u201d the twitter message said.\nOne immigration judge dismissed the limitation announced Sunday as a \u201cdrop in the bucket.\u201d\nImmigration court participants complained that they were being notified by late-night Twitter posts rather than a more detailed public announcement of how the risks and benefits were being weighed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe immigration courts need to close. Period,\u201d said Jeremy McKinney of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cMost of these hearings can wait in order to put the safety of the public first\u2026.Close the courts for a few weeks until screening and proper testing can be done.\u201d\nClosing the immigration courts altogether would create thorny issues, particularly for immigrants who are being held in custody. Such a move would likely trigger legal challenges on due process grounds.\nHowever, immigration lawyers said there are workarounds for many of the issues, including handling bond hearings via written filings and conducting hearings by video or teleconference. Video conferencing is already used to beam detainees into hearings in many courts.\nStill, some of the steps being promoted by lawyers for immigrants could be viewed as undermining aspects of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive enforcement policies.\nImmigrant advocates are urging the administration to \u201cparole\u201d into the U.S. asylum applicants sent back to Mexico under the remain-in-Mexico policy. That would be similar to the prior policy that administration officials derided as \u201ccatch and release.\u201d\nSeveral court participants said they found it ironic that immigration courts were largely shuttered during a government shutdown last year when their personnel were deemed non-essential, but now the same personnel are being told they are essential and must report to work despite officials at all levels of government urging Americans to remain home if at all possible.\n\u201cWhat is outrageous is that our non-detained courts were shut down for the government furlough, for political reasons,\u201d said Dana Leigh Marks, a San Francisco immigration judge and former president of the judges\u2019 union. \u201cYet, here we have a health emergency and no action.\""}, {"RECORDID": "20200206-24689", "label": 1, "title": "Asian stocks, oil rise as China cuts tariffs on $75bn of US goods", "body": "Stock prices leapt higher in Asia overnight after China moved to cut tariffs on some US goods.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Finance said on Thursday it would reduce tariffs on about $75bn (\u00a358bn) of goods imported from the US.

Earlier this week , Chinese President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported.\nBut one aspect of the data has received relatively less public attention: on March 26, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Zhaohui said 90% of China's imported cases held Chinese passports.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: \"Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, China and African countries have always supported each other and have always fought against the virus jointly.\n\"I would like to emphasize that the Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally, opposes any differentiated practices targeted at specific groups of people, and has zero tolerance for discriminatory words and actions.\"\nGuangzhou has long had the largest African community in China. Because many Africans in the city have short-term business visas, they travel into China several times a year, making it difficult to calculate the size of the African population the city. But in 2017, approximately 320,000 Africans entered or left China through Guangzhou, according to Xinhua.\nAfrican residents say local hostility to their presence is nothing new. But when coronavirus cases emerged in the African community this month it served to amplify existing tensions.\nA report on April 4 alleged that a Nigerian national with Covid-19 had attacked a Chinese nurse who tried to stop him leaving an isolation ward at a Guangzhou hospital\u200b. The report was shared widely on social media, and local Africans CNN spoke to say a racist backlash against the African community \u200bfollowed.\nThen on April 7, Guangzhou authorities said five Nigerians had tested positive for Covid-19.\nFearing a cluster among the African community, Guangzhou authorities upgraded the risk level of Yuexiu and Baiyun, the areas home to the city's two African enclaves, from low to medium, state-owned Global Times reported.\n\u200bThe local government Tuesday reported 111 imported cases of Covid-19 in Guangzhou, with 28 patients from the UK and 18 from the US. But in interviews with CNN, Americans and British nationals in Guangzhou said they had not heard reports of forced testing, home evictions and additional quarantine measures being imposed on members of their communities.\nOn March 21, Nigerian goods trader Chuk, who did not want to use his full name for fear of government reprisals, flew back to Guangzhou, his home since 2009. With China's coronavirus cases seemingly under control, he wanted to resume his trading business, which had been stymied by the pandemic.\nThe area around Guangzhou is a manufacturing heartland, where many Africans buy cheap goods to sell back home.\nChuk returned seven days before China closed its borders to most foreign nationals , but upon arrival, he says he was told that he needed to enter government quarantine at a hotel for two weeks.\nAs a trader, Chuk travels frequently, and is accustomed to staying in hotels during his time in China.\nBut on Tuesday, Chuk says that when he was released, along with about 15 other Africans, with a clean bill of health, they effectively became homeless.\n\"We went to the hotel with the certificate, but we were rejected,\" he said. The group went to the police station to report that hotels were refusing to let Africans stay, but \"they refused to talk to us.\"\nThe Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, which oversees the police, did not respond to CNN's request for comment about events described by anyone CNN interviewed.\nChuk says he had no choice but to sleep rough for two nights, before finding a friend's couch to crash on. \"Rain fell that day and the next and we were all drenched and our belongings soaked,\" he said.\nHis story was echoed by others who spoke to CNN.\nEarlier this week, images began circulating online of rows of Africans sleeping on the streets of Guangzhou, beside their luggage, having either been evicted from their apartments or been turned away from hotels. Other videos showed police harassing Africans on the street.\nOn Thursday, CNN called 12 hotels in Guangzhou, wanting to book a room for an African guest, and was informed by 10 that they would not be \"accepting foreign guests anymore.\"\nMeanwhile, multiple Africans CNN spoke to reported being abruptly evicted from their homes.\nNo one had evidence of a government directive asking landlords or hotels to turn away or reject foreigners. Rather, they say, these appeared to be decisions made by private individuals and business owners.\nOn Wednesday, Nigerian trader Nonso, whose name has been changed to protect his identity due to fear of government reprisals, says he and his girlfriend received a message from their landlord at 7 p.m. on WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, saying they needed to vacate their flat by 8 p.m.. \"I told him I can't vacate in one hour,\" said Nonso, who pays 1,500 yuan ($212) a month for his apartment in the Nanhai district of Guangzhou, and has lived in China for three years.\nAt 10 p.m. he says his landlord came to the flat and cut off the electricity and water supply.\n\"I asked them, what did I do? I've paid rent until September with two months' deposit. They didn't give me any reason,\" he said.\nNonso called the police, who let them \u200bremain in the apartment for the night. But in the morning, \u200bNonso says the landlord returned with a different officer, who said he had to leave. \u200bNonso says he has struggled to find a new apartment to rent. \"We have contacted a lot of agents none of them are leasing to black foreigners,\" he said.\nChris Leslie, also from Nigeria, said he was abruptly evicted from his Guangzhou apartment on Thursday, despite not defaulting on his rent and having a valid contract. He had nowhere to sleep that night. \"I will just hang out outside,\" he said. \"It is so pathetic. In a country where people don't accept you and they criticize, this is just a bitter humiliation. The most important thing is having somewhere to sleep.\"\nOn Thursday, several volunteer groups emerged on WeChat, mostly populated by scores of other foreigners, rallying around the displaced Africans, organizing food, masks and sanitation products for those left wandering the streets of Guangzhou without a bed.\nKatie Smith, an American living in Guangzhou with her Moroccan boyfriend, made two deliveries to newly homeless Africans on Thursday. Her name has been changed to protect her identity, as she, too, fears reprisal from local authorities.\n\"As we drove down the street we saw a lot of Africans walking around,\" said Smith. \"The police came and said they couldn't stay there. They're not letting them gather in groups. So they're just walking up and down the streets with nowhere to go.\"\nVideos filmed by a member of one of the WeChat volunteer groups, seen by CNN, shows police trying to prevent volunteers from helping the Africans.\n\"As a black person living in China right now it's pretty scary,\" said one volunteer who didn't want their name to be reported for similar reasons, said via WeChat. \"Don't use the African/black community as a scapegoat for the virus.\"\nThe five Nigerians confirmed to have Covid-19 had been to eight restaurants, nine hotels and 12 public places before testing positive, according to the state-run Global Times.\nSince then, Africans across Guangdong province have reported being tested in their homes, despite having no recent travel history or contact with a Covid-19 patient.\nMamelang Mmutlwane, an international student from Botswana at a Guangzhou university, said that at 3 p.m. on Sunday she received a WeChat message from her course administrator saying she needed to be tested, despite having not left China for over six months.\n\"It was only when I got there I realized it was only African students. There are other students from India (in my halls of residence, but) they were all not there. Just our small community (of Africans),\" she said. The officials took a swab from the back of her throat and said they would call if she had the virus. She never heard back.\nAs a student, Mmutlwane says she has no contact with the Nigerian trading community.\nMeanwhile, in Shenzhen, a city about 140 kilometers (87 miles) south of Guangzhou, Youssouf, a Senegalese man who did not want to disclose his surname for security reasons, said that at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, the Chinese authorities came to the apartment he shares with his Canadian wife in a compound with many foreign residents.\n\"They knocked on the door. A guy showed me his phone with my full address, my full name and my country,\" said Youssouf. He told Youssouf to go to hospital by 5 p.m. to get tested. Youssouf asked if they also wanted to test his Canadian wife. Neither of the couple had left China in the past 12 months.\n\"They said, 'No we are just testing Africans,'\" Youssouf said. Canada has more than 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and is on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' list of high-risk countries.\nThe Shenzhen municipal health commission did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\"African people are not welcome in China. We've been discriminated against repeatedly,\" he said.\nAfricans in China have long complained of racism, in the form of Chinese people holding their noses as they walk past, racially offensive adverts on television, and Chinese actors performing in blackface in a nationwide gala.\nEarlier this year, when Beijing proposed changes to its immigration laws around permanent residency, a backlash emerged on Chinese social media site Weibo against Africans. Many of the comments have since been removed from the platform.\n\n\nSmith, the American expat who helped coordinate the food drop, lives in Guangzhou with her Moroccan boyfriend.\nIn late February, the couple went on holiday to Malaysia. She returned on March 17, and says she was was asked to self-isolate at home for 14 days. He returned on March 25, and says he went into a government quarantine facility, paying 400 yuan ($56) a night at a designated hotel, and emerged on Wednesday after testing negative twice.\nOn Thursday, health authorities came to the couple's flat and said that Smith's partner, who did not want to be identified in this piece, would have to quarantine at home for 14 days because all Africans in the city were being put on lockdown, Smith says.\nSmith says her employer, an international school in Guangzhou, was informed on Thursday that all Africans needed to go into lockdown, as it has several South African employees. CNN has spoken to several other Africans who were visited by authorities on Thursday and told they needed to quarantine at home for 14 days. They say police put alarms on their front doors, which will alert officials if they leave home.\nThere have been no public statements confirming or refuting the existence of an official policy about these measures.\nSmith was told if she chose not to live in the apartment she shares with her African boyfriend, who has twice tested negative for the virus, she would not have to quarantine. \"There's resentment in Guangzhou that a lot of Africans are perceived to be here illegally and that they overstay,\" said Smith. \"There's been a push in Guangzhou to get them out. This has been an easy excuse to push this community out.\"\nWhen the authorities came to Peter Busari's Guangzhou apartment on Wednesday to test him, he filmed the exchange and went live on Facebook. That footage shows officials also asking to see his passport and checking his visa.\nWang Wei, a PhD candidate at the University of Hong Kong, who has been studying the African community in Guangzhou for several years, said testing Africans gave the government a chance to conduct a mass checking of passports, too.\n\"It threatens the undocumented Africans,\" he said. \"Officially, African foreigners (in Guangzhou) decrease every year but we all know that undocumented Africans still live in this circle doing business underground or through brokers. But because of the pandemic they will become exposed.\"\nThose caught overstaying their visas will be taken into police custody, asked to pay a 10,000 yuan ($1,421) fine and often charged for their airfare back to their home country, said Wang.\nRoberto Castillo, an assistant professor at Lingnan University, who has researched the African community in Guangzhou for nearly a decade, says the Yuexiu district where the Nigerian Covid-19 cases were found has \"historically been a place where the African community is in more tension with the authorities,\" and was a troubled site during the Ebola crisis of 2014, when Africans of all nationalities were stopped and checked, regardless of whether they were from affected nations.\nIn 2009, a riot among Africans was sparked in Yuexiu after a Nigerian man who was rumored to be undocumented was injured jumping from a building to avoid a passport check.\nAfricans in Guangzhou have been encouraged to leave the city in recent years through a series of immigration policies, economic developments and heightened policing.\nMeanwhile, on Thursday reports emerged from Africans in China that the crackdown on Africans is wider than Guangzhou. One Ghanaian family in Beijing, with no recent travel history or contact with Covid-19, reported that police came to their apartment in the early hours of Thursday morning and ordered them to leave. The Ghanaian embassy in Beijing confirmed that two Ghanaian nationals were currently seeking refuge there, but declined to comment. Africans in Chengdu and Fujian province also told CNN they had been visited by community officials.\n\n\n\"Why are we being discriminated against like this? Are there no Chinese in Africa?\" one African is heard asking a Chinese policemen on the street in Guangzhou, in a video shot on Thursday evening, as many faced another night sleeping rough on the streets of the city.\nIt is a question that speaks to the implications a crackdown on Africans in China could have on Beijing's bilateral relations with governments on the continent, which they have courted with investments for decades and where anti-Chinese sentiment is already rumbling. About 1 million Chinese are estimated to be living in Africa.\nOn Twitter , one user noted that Kenya allowed a plane of Chinese nationals to land in Nairobi, at the height of China's crisis, but when the virus reached Africa the same compassion had not been shown in Guangzhou.\nOn late Thursday night, local time in Abuja, Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama tweeted that he had invited the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria Zhou Pingjian to communicate his government's \"extreme concern at allegations of maltreatment of Nigerians in Guangzhou.\"\nChina has been trying to position itself as a friend to African states, as they battle the virus. Li Mingzhu, an official at the National Health Commission, said earlier this month that China has been sending medical teams to African countries for 57 years and would continue to offer help to African countries to improve their ability in combating the novel coronavirus outbreak.\nBut not all African nations are satisfied with that.\nGhana's finance minister called on China to ease African countries' debt burden earlier this month, while on March 31, Blessings Ramoba, President of Mining Forum of South Africa, tweeted that the coronavirus had caused the South African economy to lose \"billions of rand.\" \"The Chinese govt (sic) must cancel the debt owed by South Africa as a sign of remorse,\" he said.\nZhao Lijian, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, addressed the matter of debt earlier this week, saying: \"I believe China will resolve these countries' difficulties via consultation through diplomatic channels.\"\nCastillo said one reason the Chinese might be cracking down on Africans in Guangzhou is because they don't trust the low numbers being reported by various nations.

Even that is viewed as understated, as New York is still figuring out how best to include a surge in deaths at home in its official statistics. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2w7hX9T )\nPublic health experts have warned the U.S. death toll could reach 200,000 over the summer if unprecedented stay-at-home orders that have closed businesses and kept most Americans indoors are lifted when they expire at the end of the month.\nMost of the curbs, however, including school closures and emergency orders keeping non-essential workers largely confined to home, flow from powers vested in state governors, not the president.\nNonetheless, Trump has said he wants life to return to normal as soon as possible and that the measures aimed at curbing the spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus carry their own economic and public-health cost.\nSpeaking by telephone with Fox News on Saturday evening, Trump said he would make a decision \u201creasonably soon,\u201d based on the advice of \u201ca lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders.\u201d\nHe said \u201cinstinct\u201d would also play a role.\n\u201cPeople want to get back, they want to get back to work.

Trump, who is seeking re-election in November, will then have to decide whether to extend them or start encouraging people to go back to work and a more normal way of life.\nTrump has said he will unveil a new advisory council, possibly on Tuesday, that will include some state governors and will focus on the process of reopening the economy.\nThe number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits in the last three weeks surpassed 16 million, as weekly new claims topped 6 million for a second straight time last week.\nThe government has said the economy shed 701,000 jobs in March.

There are two reasons why we need to fly. One is obviously revenue. When a plane sits on the ground and does nothing, it costs a lot of money because it requires to be maintained even if it does not fly. The other thing is we need to restore the confidence in Kenya Airways to have KQ survive so it can provide the strategic services we need.\nNairobi is the natural place to put your headquarters for Africa, the natural place to invest. Kenya Airways will provide the connectivity needed to encourage people to put their investment here. If you look at Dubai, years ago it was nothing. Look at it to today and the only reason why Dubai is the way it is is because of Emirates. In Rwanda, President Kagame is putting a lot of money into RwandAir and the airport, so we need to do everything for Kenya Airways to survive.\nAfter resuming domestic flights and now international, how is KQ doing?\nIt is difficult to say. We are flying two times a day to Mombasa, once to Kisumu, the average load factor is 60 per cent, it\u2019s not great. But we have to get confidence during this pandemic because many people are afraid to fly, even on other international airlines. It is a wait-and-see what will be the load factor.\nWhat is your resumption plan for international flights?\nRight now we are going to fly to London three or four times a week, Amsterdam, Paris three times a week. When we go back to New York, we will probably fly once a week, Guangzhou maybe twice a week, we won't go daily . We will manage and monitor to see what the load factor is like.\nWhat informed the choice on routes?\nProjected demand. It is complex when you structure a route. For example, when you fly from here (Nairobi) to Mumbai, probably it doesn't justify the cost of that flight, but people might be coming from Lagos and then going to Mumbai and that justifies the cost of the flight. It is a very complex thing when we try to project future bookings.\nWe have, however, started taking bookings, so we are trying to see the load. As it increases, we shall put on more flights. Coming from Europe, there should be a good number of people coming here for the migration, Christmas season and like that. Then for New York during winter, we will see people wanting to come. We have gotten some good bookings from November, but we have to project and see what the future demand looks like based on forward bookings.\nHow do you give people confidence they will not catch Covid-19 on a KQ plane?\nYou do the best you can. We have very special efforts to ensure safety on the plane, including specialised air filters. People must wear masks all the time and crew will be in PPEs, among other measures.\nWhen do you expect to resume direct flights between Nairobi and New York?\nWe are looking at October. I think we will go once a week and then we will start to build up. If we see the demand, we will go two times or three times a week. I don't know when we will go back to daily flights to the US because of the pandemic.\nThere are concerns that KQ risks being short of pilots due to redundancy. What is your take?\nRight now, there is no shortage of pilots for sure. There will probably be no shortage of pilots until the industry picks up. No airline economist is predicting the return to 2019 levels until 2023 at the earliest.\nHow prepared are you to resume flights? There is a concern that most of those sent home are those who had taken recurrent training.\nFirst of all, no pilot has been sent home except maybe those who were on probation. On readiness, the way the regulations work, all the aircrafts are fully maintained even if they are on the ground. Secondly, we have been doing a lot of evacuation and freight flights, so most of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Boeing 737 pilots are flying freight or evacuation flights, so we are good to go.\nHow do you plan to deal with grounded planes, looking at cost factor and leases?\nThat\u2019s a good question. What most airlines around the world are doing is returning aircrafts on leaseholds. To return an aircraft costs loads of money, the money we don't have. We have to look for some deal. It can't be the normal penalties that they levy when you return an aircraft before your lease expires. We have to negotiate so they don't levy penalties now, we will commit to a working plan.\nSome aircraft, we can just keep because it won't cost us anything. We are going to go down from 38 aircraft to 24 aircraft. We will try to do something with the balance of our aircraft, maybe we will return them or do something else. We have nine 787s (Boeing). We will probably not return any one of them, but we will park them and use them as backup, but we have to manage this process so we can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\nManagement has been criticised on layoffs at a time when nationalisation is coming and expected to create jobs.\nCriticism will be there when you lay off people. Nobody wants to be laid off and nobody wants to do layoffs. It is really tough to let people go. Everybody can criticise you, but what do you do? Things are difficult for airlines across the globe and KQ is not an exception.\nHow are you doing the layoffs?\nWhat we have said is for people who are on contract, we don't renew their contracts, and that is not unusual in contracts. People who are close to retirement, like some of our pilots are approaching the retirement age when they are not allowed to fly, we say if you have two years to go, we will give you your salary and offer you early retirement. There are people we took from third-party providers, some on probation. We have to do it.\nHow far will the redundancy process go and how many will be affected?\nWe will finish by the end of September as long as we don't have another pandemic or obstacles. We are 4,300 people in Kenya Airways at the moment. I don't know what the eventual number will be, but it is difficult. It is a tough thing to do.\nKQ is going back into nationalisation, something that has failed before. How differently can it be done to get it right?\nGood question. If I look at Kenya Airways before, we were competing with Middle East carriers, which are are owned and subsidised by the state. Same for Ethiopian Airlines. They run the airports, catering, duty free, all these are in one holding company. That ability to put these three or four things together makes you very strong, and that is what I am trying to do with Kenya Airways.\nOur idea is to emulate what Ethiopian Airlines has done, what Emirates has done, what Turkish Airlines has done, Qatar, you name it. Integrate airport, duty free and other services. If you look at JKIA, duty free is making a lot of money, ground handling is making a lot of money, if I put those two things together and put those balance sheets together, we can leverage the balance sheet not only to rebuild the airport but also to expand the airline. That is the reason why we are doing it and we can only do it by putting them into one holding company that is owned by the state.\nHow do you plan to deal with shareholders in the nationalisation process?\nThe government currently owns nearly 50 per cent of Kenya Airways, 38 per cent is owned by the banks and seven per cent is owned by KLM. Minority shareholders own the balance. In the current financial year, we have put out some money for buying out the minority shareholders, individual shareholders; these are the people who bought shares in Kenya Airways. We have no money to buy out the banks and KLM, but our intention is to give them some kind of arrangement, that they will get their money in the next five to eight years.\nAny fears on nationalisation?\nLook at SAA (South African Airways), it was doing very well until the government started interfering with the running of the airline and putting people in charge who knew nothing about the airline. They used the airline and they ran it down. This is the fear we have and a legitimate fear. If we nationalise Kenya Airways and we put in into this aviation-holding corporation, it is state-owned. We could run it down or grow, but if you look at the Aviation Bill, we have some safeguards in there to try and prevent that.\nHow best can KQ stand competition from other airlines?\nFirst is by reducing our operating cost. We cannot compete with, say, Ethiopian Airlines and these other guys on a level playing ground because our cost of operation is high. Our average cost per kilometre, for example, compared to Ethiopian Airlines is much higher. It costs less money to fly to London by Ethiopian. Their pilots are paid 50 per cent of what our pilots are paid, the fuel is subsidised, we pay railway tax on our fuel and so forth.\nBecoming a state corporation, I am hoping that we can bring down the cost of operation. Even if we cannot bring down the cost of salaries, we can start to look at other costs and then leverage the balance sheet.\nPilots have argued that if they are brought on board, you could actually expand the airline.\nIt has been their mantra since I have been there. They say 'we could do a better job than you guys', but has any of them applied for the job of the CEO or chief commercial officer ? I would love them to come to the board or to send a representative to the board to really understand our business.\nThis is a standard language they use because that is what the international pilots' association tells them to say as union officials on how to deal with management. There are some good things they have said, like making Nairobi a business hub, absolutely 100 per cent, I agree. But when we have nobody flying, no possibility of restoration of the normal number of passengers by 2024, you want to expand? With what? How are you going to meet the costs? We can't even pay salaries.\nYou have been accused of using British Airways, a competitor, to fly on routes when you could use KQ at a cheaper cost.\nWhen I joined the board, we were in the middle of a financial restructuring. We hired Mckinsey and other financial consultants, and we were going into restructuring of the debt of Kenya Airways. That required a lot of consultation. I was still living and working in London and I had to come here a couple of times for meetings. I could only come for a day so I would take a Kenya Airways flight at around 5 from Heathrow, come for the meeting and then go back with British Airways. That is the only way you can come for a day, come with KQ and go back with BA, and vice versa.\nI answered the audit questions about why did you fly with British Airways. It is just a normal business trip but the union took it as if I am spending thousands travelling with BA. Again when you fly with KQ for free, it is on availability basis, so when it is full, you can't fly. You can't leave a fee-paying passenger and fly the chairman for free. When there was no seat in KQ, I flew British Airways and there were arrangements for cheaper tickets.\nFormer CEO Sebastian Mikosz and yourself were accused of increasing your salaries without approval. Can you explain?\nWhen I became the chairman, I said to the minister look, this is going to take a lot of my time because a lot needed to be done. So I said, I need to be paid more. KQ was going through a financial restructuring, we had just hired a new CEO, we also had to decide what are we going to do with the airline.\nWhen we went through the Public-Private-Partnership proposal, it became very intense and I was spending a lot of time with Kenya Airways. It\u2019s about the amount of effort that I had to devote to Kenya Airways as a person, not as a chairman who appears only four times a year. So I was paid not a sitting allowance but a fee. It was agreed and the following year the finance people accrued for that amount. It was shown in the balance sheet as salary paid to me.\nHowever, the board never approved it, so it had had to be reversed. I paid that money back. Currently, none of us is being paid since the pandemic. I haven't been paid since February, the CEO has taken a pay cut because we volunteered to help address the situation. I have never been dishonest. I am not that kind of person. I am very proud of my reputation.\nWhen do you think a nationalised KQ will return to profitability, and can it be privatised again?\nThis is a difficult question to answer. My view is in three or four years' time, we will be profitable if we go through what we are doing now and things work out as we predict. To re-privatise would depend on how the world looks like. But in my view, we have to get back our market share, we have to fight for our market share. Ethiopian Airlines has a grand design to be Africa's airline. It's not going to be easy, but we have to fight.\nDo you feel KQ is getting enough support from the government?\nYes, and particularly from the President. We are getting good support. I can't wish for better.\nHow have you addressed the safety alert on your Boeing 737s issued by the US Federal Aviation Authority?\nThere is a safety alert almost every day. This is not the first alert on the 737s. We always take the safety alerts seriously and we do what we are required to do. This happens all the time. We check our planes regularly so it's not an issue. Safety is always number one in an airline and KQ is no exception.\nHow do you compare leading KQ and leading Safaricom?\nDifferent challenges. One is an extremely profitable company, easy to run and one is not. When you don't have money, it is very difficult. Even to become successful, you need money. If we (KQ) are going to compete, we have to offer better service, better in-flight service, better meals, better uniform, better seats, all these will cost money.\nParting shot?\nI took up this job because I believe Kenya Airways is a strategic asset of this country. As a standalone business, we are too small to compete, we have 38 aircraft, Ethiopian has 120. It's the national thing that we have to do. It's not about pride, it's something we have to do, we have to put Nairobi on the map.\nNobody wants to fly to a destination via other airports, they want to fly directly. An airline is one thing that will attract people to come here. The government has set up an office to attract businesses, we have to have the same objective. We should protect KQ and make it work.\nEdited by T Jalio"}, {"RECORDID": "20200405-31372", "label": -1, "title": "Computex 2020 delayed until September due to coronavirus", "body": "Computex 2020, one of the world's biggest computer shows, has officially been rescheduled until September due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nOriginally, Computex 2020 was due to take place in Taipei, Taiwan between June 2 and June 6, 2020.\nHowever, in a press release announcing the delay, the fact that \"the world is affected by severe infection pneumonia (Covid-19),\" is cited as the reason for rescheduling the event, which will now take place between September 28 - 30, \u00a0at the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center, which is on the outskirts of the city.\nWhile the Covid-19 epidemic has been relatively well contained in Taiwan, the delay comes as little surprise.

Gulf governments have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on stimulus packages to shore up the livelihoods of citizens but have offered no direct financial relief for the migrants who in countries such as Qatar and the UAE make up more than 87% of the population.\n\u201cMore than 200,000 people are relying on food aid,\u201d said Krishna Neupane, a Nepali citizen working in Kuwait. He said his company was paying 75% of his salary but that thousands of others had lost their jobs and were struggling to keep up with rental payments.\nIn Oman and Bahrain, mass quarantines were seen by some as an opportunity to send workers home, accelerating a process of encouraging their own citizens to take up their jobs where possible, said Froilan Malit Jr, a researcher at Cambridge University who studies migrant worker populations.\nThe UAE has allowed legal migrant workers to take vacation time early to ride out the pandemic in their home countries with the hope they can return within a few months, while encouraging workers who have lost their jobs to talk to their national embassies about going home.\nIndia has sent navy ships to Dubai to collect some of its citizens and arranged repatriation flights for those who can afford them. Kuwait has waived fines for undocumented workers who want to leave and offered to pay their fares. It has also said those who do go home may be able to return.\nIn Lebanon, limited repatriations for some of the country\u2019s estimated 250,000 migrant workers, mostly domestic workers or labourers, have been made possible. But so far fewer than 3,000 workers have managed to leave. Those who remain face a bleak future, with a plunge in the currency slashing the dollar value of salaries.\n\u201cI used to be able to send money home, but since last December I haven\u2019t worked and have no more money to send,\u201d said Olido, 44. \u201cI did not think I would be here for 14 years, I thought I was going to finish my contract then head home. My eldest was nine when I left. My second child was six, and my twins were five years old. I haven\u2019t seen them in person since. I sacrificed for them and stayed.\u201d\nRelated slideshow: Coronavirus outbreak (Provided by Photo Services)\nA report released on Friday predicted that millions of workers would eventually leave the region as the post-lockdown recession took hold, dramatically cutting the population of some states.\n\u201cDependence on expat workers in vulnerable sectors means the burden of job losses will fall on the expat population,\u201d Scott Livermore, the chief economist at Oxford Economics Middle East, writes in the study. \u201cCombined with visas depending on employment and lack of a social safety net, an expat exodus is likely as travel restrictions are eased. This could result in the population declining by between 4% (in Saudi Arabia and Oman) and around 10% (in the UAE and Qatar).\u201d\nFor now, though, many workers are attempting to ride things out. \u201cA lot of those staying say they can survive for the next three to five months,\u201d said Malit Jr. \u201cBefore they could afford to buy McDonald\u2019s, now they chip in five dirhams [\u00a31.12] per person for 10 people and eat collectively, so they can have three meals per day. Some are cooking their local delicacies and selling them online to other workers. Back home there are no job opportunities, and they know the cost of going home then returning to the Gulf is going to be high.\u201d"}, {"RECORDID": "20200730-61036", "label": 0, "title": "INC Interviews Leadership Team for Insights into COVID-19 and the Nut and Dried Fruit Industry", "body": "REUS, Spain , July 30, 2020 /CNW/ -- Full Article : https://www.nutfruit.org/industry/publications/inc-magazine/articles/detail/inc-leadership-perspective-on-covid-19\nAs the world continues to grapple with the implications of the COVID-19, the INC reached out to various members of the leadership, to interview and gain their perspective of how the nut and dried fruit industry has been affected by the pandemic.\nOne of the most repeated answers among the leadership was that the nut and dried fruit industry most certainly has faced numerous challenges with COVID-19, however there are many reasons to be optimistic for the future. Behrooz Agah , from the Agah Group in Iran and an INC Ambassador to Iran commented, \"promotion and increased awareness as to the benefits of consumption of different products in this section on general health and well-being\" is likely to be of increased importance in the aftermath of COVID-19.

Among other things, it gives the country a hook to bring federal resources to bear on cases that for whatever reason may be difficult for states to bring.\nBut the general idea of viewing the coronavirus as a \u201cbiological agent\u201d akin to anthrax or botulism, and its \u201cpossession\u201d or transmission as a crime of terrorism, is as novel as the virus and it carries its own exponential dangers.\nUntil now, the core concept of a biological agent in terrorism law is an engineered or synthesized toxin, like anthrax. Shifting that definition to a naturally occurring virus we all can catch and carry, and one we so far know so little about, is not just inapt, it\u2019s overkill. We should confine terrorism crimes to offenses involving violence and intimidation against a large body of civilians in pursuit of political aims.\nThere are legitimate applications of the DOJ\u2019s definition. The paradigm for federal jurisdiction would be cases we\u2019ve recently heard about that the FBI is investigating: Neo-Nazi and white supremacists encouraging members who become infected to spread the disease to police officers and to Jews, whom they view, in the time-honored irrational fashion of anti-Semites, as responsible for the virus.\nLife in prison \u2014 the sentence for federal crimes of terrorism \u2014 seems like fitting punishment for such heinous conduct. But for many other potential coronavirus crimes or civil offenses, what could follow from the \"biological agent\" rubric is just not right.\nThere already have been reported instances of people threatening others with the virus. A New Jersey man breathed on someone and then said he had the virus. A woman in a supermarket in Pennsylvania coughed on fresh produce and announced: \u201cI have coronavirus and you are all going to get sick.\u201d She next tried to shoplift a 12-pack of Coors Light. State authorities charged her with two felony counts of terrorist threats and, perhaps with the DOJ in mind, one count of threats to use a \u201cbiological agent.\u201d\nAntisocial, sad sack criminal conduct? Yes. But domestic terrorism akin to building a bomb and trying to set it off in Times Square?\nOr imagine what lawyers would consider the potential \"reckless\" transmission of the disease. On Monday, Florida authorities arrested the pastor of a local church who held services in contravention of stay-at-home orders.\nHe was charged with unlawful assembly and violation of public health emergency rules, both second-degree misdemeanors. But combine his recalcitrance with the DOJ\u2019s definition of the virus as a biological agent, and the possible end result is a range of federal felony charges, including, if a parishioner contracts the disease and dies, reckless homicide.\nMost panoramically, there could be \"negligent\" transmission of the virus, not with the intent to harm or even done recklessly, but done without taking proper care nonetheless. This kind of transmission will most certainly occur, tragically, in thousands of cases.\nFor example, The Times recently reported on a choral group in Washington state that decided to go forward with practice notwithstanding the then-rapid spread of the virus in Seattle. Today, 45 members are infected, three have been hospitalized and two have died. The DOJ\u2019s definition increases the prospects for recovery in a civil case associated with such conduct, along with the likely amounts. It might also push local authorities, who are eager to appear aggressive in combating the coronavirus, toward a charge of criminal liability.\nThe memorandum from the department doesn\u2019t quite seal the deal on how the law will view coronavirus, but because the department is the agency tasked with administering the criminal code, the courts usually defer to its interpretations. Unfortunately, the memo may serve as a giant step toward making transmission of a disease into chemical warfare and suicide bombs.\nThere will have to be some reckoning down the line related to COVID-19, some assignment of fault for at least the most culpable transmitters of the disease. The courts might attempt to look to normal principles of everyday liability, including for negligence, as they have done (with notably inconsistent results), in cases of transmission of AIDs. More likely, the immensity and unprecedented nature of the coronavirus threat will require a legislative solution from Congress, involving partial compensation and rough justice.\nBut it would be a mistake to rely generally on a body of law developed for acts of terrorism to account for the spread of the coronavirus. Confronting the legion problems of the pandemic is daunting enough without reconceptualizing disease as a massive terrorist attack from within.\nHarry Litman is a former U.S. attorney and host of the podcast \"Talking Feds .\"  @harrylitman"}, {"RECORDID": "20200714-68376", "label": -1, "title": "Trump's demand that schools fully reopen spurned by big districts", "body": "President Donald Trump has spent the past two weeks demanding \u2014 often in all caps on Twitter \u2014 that American schools reopen this fall.\nBut America's biggest school systems are rejecting the president across the country, with one city and county after another opting for virtual education or just a few days a week in school.

Instead, the company has had to diversify to retain its revenue stream after losing around \u00a3500,000 ($640,000) in sales because of canceled events \u2014 and did so by selling this niche rum.\nThe Yorkshire Explorer was set up two years ago by Callum Houston as a distilling arm to the events business, and has since produced artisanal gin with ingredients such as pink peppercorns, basil, and lavender. But this is the company's first foray into rum, and was a desperate make-or-break venture to keep both companies afloat during the pandemic.\n\"Some people get put off by the idea of seaweed,\" Houston said, but added that people are increasingly willing to try new things \u2014 a bit like the Yorkshire Explorer itself. And many customers are pleasantly surprised by the product, with Houston saying that \"people absolutely love it.\"\nClearly there is a thirst for this local produce. The first batch of the rum sold out less than two weeks after its August 20 launch. Though many buyers were within Yorkshire, there was also high demand from both bars and consumers in London, and the company was even contacted by customers from the Ukraine and Sweden.\nGallery: How Starbucks drinks have changed over the last 10 years, from strawless lids to real pumpkin in the PSL (Business Insider)\nThe product can't currently be sent overseas, but the company told Business Insider it is looking into exporting abroad, including to the US, a huge drinks market.\nThis may seem surprising given how much of the product's image is based on its Yorkshire heritage, but Houston argued Yorkshire has an \"incredibly strong brand\" that \"resonates across the world.\"\nThe rum is made using dried seaweed processed by Scarborough-based SeaGrown, which farms seaweed on England's north-east coast. SeaGrown is England's first large-scale, commercial seaweed farm, and it also produces seaweed for use in bioplastics, bath products, and food seasonings, but this is its first time growing for rum.\nThe seaweed in question is sugar kelp, which is naturally both sweet and salty. This is combined with Madagascan vanilla, local heather, and honey, clove, and ginger to produce a rum that is smooth and warming with no real harshness. The rum is best served on the rocks, Houston added, saying that \"if you put so much effort into making it taste good, I don't know why you'd want to put anything else into it.\"\nThough this may be England's first sugar kelp rum, a different take on seaweed rum has proved a hit in Wales. Barti Rum has been distilling its product since 2017 using laver seaweed from the Welsh region of Pembrokeshire. Its rum, like Houston's, is flavored with vanilla and cloves, but contains orange too. And like the Yorkshire Explorer, Barti's product plays heavily on its local heritage \u2013 the rum is even named after a pirate from the region.\nLaver seaweed used to be a popular food in South Wales, where it is washed then boiled to make the local delicacy laverbread. Whereas sugar kelp is grown further out to sea, laver seaweed is found on beaches, and can still be picked in Pembrokeshire.\nSurprisingly, it wasn't actually the seaweed that came first when the Yorkshire Explorer was designing its new product. The company knew it needed to try all it could to weather the effects of the pandemic on its events services arm. Though its past experience was with gin, the market has become oversaturated, Houston said, making it hard to get both visibility and market share for new products. So the company decided to launch into the ever-expanding spiced rum market.\nThe Yorkshire Explorer wanted to replicate the flavor of salted caramel in its rum, but the company has a strict ethos of using no artificial flavorings and foraging wherever possible. Sugar kelp had already been used in gins to provide a sweet and salty flavor similar to salted caramel, but isn't widely available in rum. Using Yorkshire seaweed would give the product a unique selling point and allow the company to \"put an element of Yorkshire back into the bottle,\" Houston said.\nMore unique flavors may be on the way. The company, which has a strong emphasis on sustainability and waste reduction, is currently experimenting with rum made from fermented banana peel."}, {"RECORDID": "20200410-10300", "label": -1, "title": "COVID-19 LIVE UPDATES: Missouri climbs to almost 3,800 cases, Kansas tops 1,100", "body": "The Kansas City metro area continues to adjust to stay-at-home orders that have been issued to help combat the spread of COVID-19 .\nFRIDAY 2:45 p.m. -- The Wyandotte County Health Department said Friday the county added 23 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and four more people have died from coronavirus-related ailments.\nThe county said there are now 300 confirmed cases in Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, and 20 deaths in the county.

The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020 .\nMr. Wong Wah On Edward , the Company's Chairman, commented on the results: \"During 2020, we are preparing supporting documentation for the detailed geographical exploration report for official filing after the review and comment of the relevant government authorities. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely disrupted our operations. Governmental control measures imposed to contain its spread have impacted our business by restricting the movement of our employees since the beginning of the pandemic in the PRC through mid-March, when we were able to partially re-open. COVID-19 has also affected our suppliers' workforces, and as a result we are experiencing a slow resumption of operations and may experience delays or the inability to deliver goods on a timely basis. The market demand for the copper that we trade and the metals that we may mine has similarly been negatively impacted by COVID-19 as a result of the sharp decrease in manufacturing and other activity due to the widespread closure of businesses in the PRC and worldwide. On August 17, 2020 , we acquired marketable shares of Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited, which we anticipate will serve as tools to pursue potential attractive opportunities. On September 2, 2020 , we received a letter from Nasdaq informing us that we had regained compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, allowing continued access to the capital markets for ourselves and liquidity for our shareholders.\"\nFor the convenience of the reader, amounts in Chinese Yuan (\"CNY\") have been translated into United States dollars (\"US$\") at the rate of US$1.00 = CNY7.0655 , as quoted by www.ofx.com on June 30, 2020 .

These statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the intent, belief and current expectations of the Company, its directors or its officers with respect to the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's operations and markets, the Company's continued compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the impact on the Company's financial position as a result of the acquisition of the shares of Feishang Anthracite Resources Limited, and its ability to locate and execute on strategic opportunities. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to differ from its forward-looking statements are: uncertainties regarding governmental, economic and political circumstances in the PRC; uncertainties associated with metal price volatility; uncertainties related to the Company's ability to fund operations; uncertainties relating to possible future increases in operating expenses, including costs of labor and materials; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic; uncertainties regarding the political situation between the PRC and the United States , and potential negative impacts on companies with operations in the PRC that are listed on exchanges in the United States ; and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC, including without limitation the information set forth in our Annual Reports on Form 20-F under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" When, in any forward-looking statement, the Company, or its management, expresses an expectation or belief as to future results, that expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and is believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the stated expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.

Even in the time of coronavirus, prices have remained steady. Between park tickets, themed hotel rooms, skip-the-line passes and souvenirs, the expenses add up quickly. In the search for savings, families will find it easier right now to use points to save money on trips to Universal Orlando than Walt Disney World.\nFor more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter .\nThe Chase Ultimate Rewards program can be a jack-of-all-trades in covering the costs of a Universal Orlando vacation. Let\u2019s consider your lodging.\nUniversal Orlando Resort has three Premier-class hotels: Loews Royal Pacific Resort, The Hard Rock Hotel\u00a0and Loews Portofino Bay Hotel . Reservations at each of these hotels include Express Passes, Universal Orlando\u2019s cut-the-line pass that are valued at up to $279 per person, per day. Yes, you read that right. On the busiest days of the year, Universal Orlando will charge you almost $300 for Express Passes. For a family of four, Express Passes can easily surpass $500 in costs daily, so it\u2019s best to book hotels that confer the passes if you want them. (If you\u2019re visiting during a busy time of year, you may need the pass to avoid lines and see and do more.)\nThe lower tiers of Universal Orlando hotels don\u2019t include Express Passes but do offer early access to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter . That\u2019s great if anyone in your family has their heart set on trying Hagrid\u2019s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, a roller coaster with a notoriously long wait (and no Express Pass line). Some of the Universal hotel options that don\u2019t include Express Passes also can be really family-friendly. For example, the Aventura Hotel has family rooms.\nRelated:  TPG\u2019s complete guide to Universal Orlando\nAll Universal Orlando hotels are available for booking through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal. The value of your Chase points will vary based on the card you hold. You\u2019ll get the highest value if you have the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae: Your points are then worth 1.5 cents each toward booking travel.\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card and Chase Ink Business Preferred\u00ae Credit Card both offer slightly less (1.25 cents) in value per Ultimate Rewards point redeemed for travel, while the Chase Freedom Flex card will provide you with a value of just 1 cent per point. However, if you have the Sapphire Reserve, you can transfer the points you have earned on your other Chase Ultimate Rewards cards, like the Freedom, to Sapphire Reserve and then redeem at 1.5 cents each.\nThe information for the Chase Freedom Flex has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\nOne small caveat when booking through the Ultimate Rewards travel portal: The \u201cprice\u201d in points that you see displayed in the search results doesn\u2019t include taxes, so it is likely understated a bit. Points prices and cash prices vary by date; on a test date in mid-December, the Universal Orlando hotels ranged from 8,000 to 20,000 Ultimate Rewards points per night.\nThe Chase Ultimate Rewards portal offers a variety of Universal Orlando park tickets for redemption. (It also sometimes sells Disney tickets \u2014 but not always.) Ultimate Rewards previously charge a $10 convenience fee that can be paid in points, though we didn\u2019t find it in our most recent searches. Prices will vary based on what type of ticket you\u2019re searching for.\u00a0 In our most recent searches, the Ultimate Rewards portal was anywhere from $5 to $10 cheaper per day. Some of that is due to differences in taxes, the rest is hard to tell. Universal Orlando typically offers a variety of tickets and some pretty worthwhile promotional opportunities, so it\u2019s worth it to read through each ticket type.\nLike Disney World, Universal Orlando charges different prices depending on the day you want to visit. It\u2019s worth looking at the ticket calendar before you book to see if you can target cheaper dates. Even shifting from a Saturday to Friday or Sunday in March or April would save you $5 to $10 per ticket on some weekends.\nAt the same time, Universal Orlando can sometimes offer ticket deals that may or may not be available in the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. For example, there\u2019s currently a deal where you get three days free when you buy a two-day ticket that gives you access to all three parks. Right now, that deal is in the Chase portal, but that isn\u2019t always the case.\nFinally, consider a Universal annual pass if you\u2019re visiting during a peak time. Our family of four found we could save money purchasing annual passes instead of buying two-day park tickets with Express Passes. We sacrificed the all-day Express Pass option for one that starts at 4 p.m. every day and ended up with a year\u2019s worth of Hogwarts for the price of two (times four) days of tickets.\nRelated: Best credit cards for Disney and Universal vacations\nJust as you can use Chase Ultimate Rewards points at a fixed-value to book an official Universal Orlando hotel room, you can use your Citi ThankYou points to do the same via the ThankYou travel site. Those with a Citi Premier\u00ae Card or Citi Prestige\u00ae Card can redeem points at a fixed 1 cent per point value toward travel.\nThe information for the Citi Prestige Card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\nRelated:  How to get the most out of one day at Universal Studios\nAdditionally, Prestige cardholders can book a three-night stay and then use the card\u2019s fourth-night-free benefit that is available for any hotel booked through the ThankYou portal using the card (using points, cash or a combo of the two). ( Learn how to redeem Citi ThankYou points for maximum value here .)\nHowever, when it comes to theme park tickets, using ThankYou points isn\u2019t as good a deal as using Chase points, since activities cash out at just 1 cent per point, even with the Prestige or Premier cards.\nThere are several chain hotels located near Universal Orlando Resort, which gives you lots of opportunities to use those hotel points. During our visits last year, I watched a Hyatt House rise out of the ground and it is now open for business. Hyatt House is an excellent choice for families .\nMany rooms feature a kitchen and separate bedrooms. Hyatt is a 1:1 transfer partner of Ultimate Rewards , so it\u2019s easy to use your points for a free stay. You can also use points from the World of Hyatt Credit Card, and even the annual Category 1\u20134 award provided by that card, to book the Hyatt House Across From Universal Orlando Resort or Hyatt Place Across From Universal Orlando Resort. Both are Category 3 properties with nightly redemptions that start at 12,000 Hyatt points per night.\nRelated:  How to choose the right hotel for your Universal Orlando vacation\nThis Hyatt House is a Universal Partner property, which means you\u2019ll get certain discounts in the parks and at CityWalk, Universal\u2019s dining, shopping and entertainment venue. You can walk from the hotel to the parks or enjoy free scheduled shuttle service. Combine this with a ticket deal through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal and you could go from spending thousands of dollars on a Harry Potter-themed vacation to spending cash on your magic wand and Butterbeer.\nIf you don\u2019t have a lot of points or miles available at the moment, there are still ways to save on a Universal Orlando vacation. Look for discounted Universal Orlando tickets on Undercover Tourist.  Even when there\u2019s a price increase on tickets at the parks , Undercover Tourist will usually have inventory at the older prices for a short time. Make sure to pay with your Chase Sapphire Reserve to earn 3 points per dollar on the travel charge via Undercover Tourist. Getaway Today is another reputable discount ticket agency that can usually save you money on Universal Orlando tickets.\nRelated:  The best credit cards for entertainment spending\nAs a side note, not all discount ticket sites are created equal. We trust Undercover Tourist based on experience and its solid reputation. But fake theme park tickets are a real thing and will sting you if you don\u2019t use common sense. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.\nAmerican Express is the official credit card of Universal Orlando. That means you\u2019re eligible for a handful of benefits, including 10% off certain dining plans and 10% off merchandise when you spend $75 or more. There\u2019s even an American Express lounge in Universal Studios theme park.

The 2020 version of Daily Getaways has been postponed until further notice.\nLast, but far from least, fixed-value points /miles from credit cards such as the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card and Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard (currently closed to new applicants) can make it very easy to book a hotel or even an entire Universal Orlando vacation package and then use points on the card(s) to pay off some or all of the charge.

A rate that stays above 1 means the virus is spreading exponentially.\nFears that a second wave of infections could thwart the reopening of the global economy helped send share prices lower across the world, and pushed depressed oil prices down still further.\nThe past month has seen investors bet strongly on a rapid economic recovery in spite of data far worse than any in living memory. That has opened a rift between soaring stock markets and the freefalling economies they are meant to reflect.\nTrump, now running for re-election in November against the background of a crippled economy, is pushing U.S. states for a rapid reopening, against the recommendations of health experts to move more cautiously to avoid a resurgence of the virus, which has killed more than 80,000 people in the United States.\nSome of the hardest-hit states are led by Democratic governors, such as Pennsylvania; the Republican president has encouraged reopening in those states in defiance of their governors with tweets urging people to \"liberate\" them.\n\"The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails,\" he tweeted on Monday. \"The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes.\"\nEUROPE REOPENS SLOWLY\nIn Europe, Spain and France took major new steps to ease strict lockdowns, while Britain, second only to the United States in its death toll, unveiled cautious moves that critics said sent mixed messages.\nIn Paris, traffic flowed along the Champs Elysees as workers cleaned shopfronts to reopen for the first time since March.\n\"Everyone's a little bit nervous. Wow! We don't know where we're headed but we're off,\" said Marc Mauny, a hair stylist who opened his salon in western France at the stroke of midnight.\nMickey Mouse welcomed thinned-out crowds in Shanghai, the first Disney theme park to reopen, with a strict limit on tickets. Parades and fireworks were cancelled, and workers and guests had to wear face masks and have their temperatures screened.\n\"I think (these measures) make tourists feel at ease,\" said Kay Yu, a 29-year-old pass holder wearing a Minnie Mouse hat.\nHowever, the city of Wuhan in central China, origin of the global outbreak, reported its first cluster of infections since its severe lockdown was lifted a month ago.\nGermany is being watched worldwide as the most successful large European country in halting the spread of the virus, thanks to a massive testing programme.\nIt is gradually reopening shops and factories, with restaurants and cafes expected to open their doors soon.\nAfter a rise in the estimated reproduction rate or 'R' to 1.13 at the weekend, Monday saw new cases fall back, but the 'R' value at 1.07 was still above the critical threshold of 1.00.\nGerman officials say that 'R' becomes more volatile as the overall number of infections declines, and a brief spike is not necessarily dangerous.\nBut Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was crucial that \"people stick to the basic rules\" on keeping their distance, wearing masks and showing consideration for others.\n'IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER'\nIn South Korea, which largely avoided a lockdown with a massive early testing and contact-tracing programme, authorities were rushing to contain a new outbreak traced to night clubs.\n\"It's not over until it's over...We must never lower our guard,\" President Moon Jae-In said on Sunday.\nBritain's government offered ministerial briefings and documents to expand on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's 13-minute television address on Sunday setting out a phased path towards reopening the economy.\nThe plan includes advice on avoiding public transport and wearing face coverings as well as a 14-day quarantine for most international arrivals, and detailed guidance for employers.\nDr Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergencies programme, urged \"extreme vigilance\" in the form of testing and contact tracing as countries loosened restrictions.\n\"If the disease persists at a low level without the possibility to investigate clusters, there's always the possibility that the virus takes off again,\" he told an online news briefing.\nThe WHO noted that Germany, South Korea and China all had such programmes.\nSome of the countries and territories that are opening up their economies are not waiting for sustained falls in the spread of the virus.\nRussia overtook Italy and Britain to report the world's highest tally of cases after the United States and Spain. Nevertheless, President Vladimir Putin announced plans to ease nationwide lockdown measures from Tuesday.\nIndia, which has locked down its 1.3 billion people since March, reported a record daily rise in cases, yet said it would begin to restart passenger railway services, with 15 special trains, from Tuesday.\nIn an effort to provide better information worldwide on the pandemic, Twitter said it would add labels and warning messages to some tweets with disputed or misleading information about COVID-19.\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaux Writing by Kevin Liffey Editing by Mark Heinrich)"}, {"RECORDID": "20200212-55214", "label": 0, "title": "Shopify, Bed Bath & Beyond, Google, Apple: Companies to Watch", "body": "Here are the companies the Yahoo Finance team is watching for you today.\nShopify ( SHOP ) is climbing this morning after posting a big beat on earnings and revenue last quarter.
