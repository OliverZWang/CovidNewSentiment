'''
A model that computes the VADER sentiment scores of an article both as a long String and by sentence

Arguments:

    article:                The content of an article as a String
    

Attributes:

    scores_by_article: A dictionary of VADER scores with keys of 'neg', 'neu', 'pos', and 'compound'
    compound_by_article: The compound score value of the previous attribute (scores_by_article)
    average_sentence: The average of the sentiment scores of all sentences
    median_sentence: The median of the sentiment scores of all sentences
    mode_sentence: The mode of the sentiment scores of all sentences
    pstd_sentence: The population standard deviation of the sentiment scores of all sentences

Methods:

    result_dict:                Returns a dictionary of class attributes mapped to their values

Example:

    article = "FDA Delays Emergency Vaccine Approval Until They Finish Evaluating New Bagged Salad Kit. Clarifying that the federal agency would take a look at Pfizerâ€™s submission eventually, the FDA announced Friday that it would delay the emergency coronavirus vaccine approval until they were finished evaluating a bagged salad kit. "
    article_scores = SentimentScores(article)
    print(article_scores.compound_by_article)

    score_dict = article_scores.result_dict()
    print(score_dict)
